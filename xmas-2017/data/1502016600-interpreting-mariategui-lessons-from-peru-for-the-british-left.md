Interpreting Mariátegui: Lessons from Peru for the British Left
===============================================================

It is difficult to interpret exactly why José Carlos Mariátegui is such
an unknown figure among the pantheon of international Marxist thinkers
regularly discussed or referenced by the British Left. In part, this
lack of knowledge, of arguably Latin America’s greatest Marxist thinker,
could be explained by his early death at only the age of 35. Another
explanation could simply be a degree of snobbish Eurocentrism which
dismisses figures from the so-called developing world as being unable to
contribute to knowledge in the so-called Global North.

But perhaps the most convincing explanation can be found in Mariátegui’s
greatest potential contribution to Leftist thinking in the UK. That is
because Mariátegui did not simply attempt to apply Marxist (or
Marxist-Leninist) doctrine to Peru, but adapted international theories
of class struggle to the society which he saw around him. In short, he
developed a class-based analysis of Peruvian society which was as rooted
in the realities of national, regional and local politics as it was in
the European ideas of global proletarian struggle.

Although Mariátegui’s life and work describes a world both temporally
and spatially distant from the present day UK, his form of analysis has
important implications for understanding the role of the Left in Britain
today. At present, the Labour Party appears on course for further
internal division, not just between the Corbynite and Blairite wings of
the party but also between two competing interpretations of the
relationship of the Left to class. [MPs such as Phil Wilson (MP for
Sedgefield)](https://t.co/x4Kfo8lLdN), who represent mostly northern
constituencies which have greatly suffered the effects of
deindustrialisation, argue that while Corbyn’s Labour is increasingly
attractive to students and residents of the UK’s big cities, they have
lost their connection to the working-class communities in former
industrial heartlands of the north.

Advocating for a more nationally-based understanding of socialism in
this context may appear rather alarming to some (not least because of
the historical connotations of “national socialism”), but this is by no
means a call to install immigration controls and do away with
international solidarity. What Mariátegui argued for in the case of
Peru, particularly in his [*Seven Interpretative Essays on Peruvian
Reality*
(1928)](https://www.marxists.org/archive/mariateg/works/7-interpretive-essays/),
was for a more complex understanding of class which pays attention to
the influence of race and ethnicity, co-existing modes of production and
the politics of space in a given nation.

This re-examination of the nature of class alongside contemporary
politics and economics is absolutely vital. Like it or not,
deindustrialisation and Thatcherism have changed the British landscape,
and with it they have vastly altered the rules of the game for the
Labour Party and Left in general. Whilst a re-examination or where we go
from here has already begun (see these *New Socialist* analyses on
re-interpreting class through
[geography](https://newsocialist.org.uk/islington-redefined/) and
[gender](https://newsocialist.org.uk/women-voting-labour/)), it is vital
for the British Left to continue this work to move forward, and for the
Labour Party to continue to appeal to the populations of former
industrial heartlands as well as major urban centres.

This project could benefit greatly from a closer reading of Mariátegui’s
life and writing, a more detailed analysis of which you will find in the
paragraphs below.

Life of Mariátegui
------------------

Born in 1894, Mariátegui spent most of his early twenties writing for a
number of increasingly radical left-wing magazines and newspapers in
Peru’s capital, Lima. In 1918, he set up his own left-wing publication,
*La Razón*, which marked his turn towards socialism and away from the
Creole politics represented by Lima’s whiter middle-class (as opposed to
the indigenous, Quechua-speaking population of Peru, located
predominantly in Andean regions). Mariátegui was influenced by the
Peruvian anarchist Manuel González Prada, and both became highly
critical of the domination of land ownership by a small group of
land-owners (known as *latifundistas* or *gamonales*).

Although the 1910s and 1920s were an important period for the
development of the Peruvian Left, they were also marked by state
suppression. After a coup d’état in 1919 which brought Augusto Leguía
into power for his second Presidential term, Mariátegui was faced with
the probability of going into prison or exile, of which he (perhaps
preemptively) chose the latter. On returning to Peru, Mariátegui worked
closely with the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance (APRA) led by
Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre. However, APRA’s suppression (and
anti-communist rhetoric) led Mariátegui to leave and set up his own
socialist party, which would later become the Peruvian Communist Party
(PCP). He was also involved in the creation of the General Confederation
of Peruvian Workers (CGTP) which took part in the Latin American trade
union conference in 1929.

Sadly, the next year he died a young death at the age of 35.

*Seven Interpretative Essays on Peruvian Reality*
-------------------------------------------------

Mariátegui’s influence and impact on future generations of the Latin
American Left, however, had already been secured. His 1928 book *Seven
Interpretative Essays on Peruvian Reality*
[(SIEoPR)](https://www.marxists.org/archive/mariateg/works/7-interpretive-essays/)
is, in part, a Marxist economic analysis of Peru’s history which
understood the country as a semi-feudal nation dominated by the
political and economic power of the *latifundistas*. The
*latifundistas*, Mariátegui argued, were “indifferent not only to the
interests of the proletariat but also to those of the bourgeoisie”, and
as such were guilty of consigning Peru to economic underdevelopment.

What Mariátegui saw in Peru convinced him of two major critiques of
international Marxist thought in the 1920s. Although the *latifundistas*
were an agrarian nobility, they also accumulated capital and acted as
capitalists by making alliances with foreign (predominantly British)
business interests. Therefore, Mariátegui saw both feudal and capitalist
modes of production existing simultaneously in Peruvian society, instead
of a linear progression from one to the other. Secondly, Mariátegui saw
that the power of the *latifundistas* was so great, and that the
Peruvian state was structured so completely in their favour and the
interests of international capital, that Peruvian society would not
simply progress dialectically from feudalism to capitalism to socialism,
but was instead consigned to existing in its semi-feudal,
semi-capitalist state.

However, SIEoPR is far more than a simple economic history. The second
essay, [“The Problem of the
Indian”](https://www.marxists.org/archive/mariateg/works/7-interpretive-essays/essay02.htm),
is devoted to Mariátegui’s understanding of the integration of the
indigenous population into Peruvian society, and the potential for
indigenous communities to develop as a proletariat. In this essay, he
argues that:

> ANY TREATMENT OF THE PROBLEM of the Indian—written or verbal—that
> fails or refuses to recognize it as a socio-economic problem is but a
> sterile, theoretical exercise destined to be completely
> discredited...Any attempt to solve it with administrative or police
> measures, through education or by a road building program, is
> superficial and secondary as long as the feudalism of the gamonales
> continues to exist.
>
> In articulating this position, Mariátegui defines the social
> integration of indigenous communities as fundamentally one of class
> struggle. However, he adds greater complexity to this picture by also
> highlighting the importance of cultural and social factors which
> reinforce the indigenous population’s lowly class position. Mariátegui
> appears well ahead of his time, articulating an understanding of
> society and Marxist theory which is rooted in the politics of space
> long before [Henri
> Lefebvre](https://monoskop.org/images/7/75/Lefebvre_Henri_The_Production_of_Space.pdf)
> and others. In doing so, he does not simply apply a class-based
> analysis to explain Peru, but highlights how traditional Marxist
> understandings of class must be adapted to understand indigenous
> integration.

The rest of SIEoPR deals with a number of issues including religion,
education, literature and land reform. Taken together, these chapters
highlight the numerous forms of exclusion experienced by the indigenous
population: racial, economic, spatial, social, and cultural. In this
way, Mariátegui demonstrates that while the indigenous population’s
exclusion is fundamentally rooted in economics and the land, their
position as a class is far more complex than a simple economic
calculation.

The importance of Mariátegui today
----------------------------------

Mariátegui today remains a writer underappreciated outside of Latin
America. In Peru, his legacy remains strong having influenced Leftist
thinkers such as [Alberto Flores
Galindo](http://home.uchicago.edu/aabbott/barbpapers/barbflor.pdf)
(although his grand-nephew Aldo is a staunch right-winger, a sort of
Peruvian Piers Morgan who has written his own *Eighth Essay*) and
through the mobilization of the CGTP, although the PCP has long-since
fractured into a myriad factions (many of whom engaged in open conflict
with the state in the second half of the twentieth century). In other
Andean countries, his writings on the indigenous population remain
relevant for those who, like Flores Galindo, believe that the
mobilisation of the indigenous population is the most logical route to
socialism.

The potential for Mariátegui’s writings to shape understandings of
British society has certainly not been written about in any great depth.
Yet, rather than seeing any direct comparisons between the 1920s
Peruvian society he describes and our own, his writings on class,
culture and the politics of land and space have important contributions
to make if the British Left is to truly revitalise its own intellectual
proposition in the near future.
