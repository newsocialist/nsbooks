Introducing The Politics of Contemporary Motherhood and Mums4Corbyn
===================================================================

Mums4Corbyn will be holding three events, [Home Truths: Housing is A
Feminist
Issue](https://theworldtransformed.org/sessions/home-truths-housing-is-a-feminist-issue/),
[Radical Demands from the
Grassroots](https://theworldtransformed.org/sessions/a-womans-place-is-radical-demands-from-the-grassroots/)
and Whose Job is it anyway? [Radical
Childcare](https://theworldtransformed.org/sessions/a-womans-place-is-radical-demands-from-the-grassroots/),
at which Andrea Marie will be speaking, at [The World
Transformed](https://theworldtransformed.org/) in Brighton on September
23rd.

The idea of Mums4Corbyn, that is mothers organising as mothers within a
Corbyn-led or left-led Labour Party (the point is not so much about
Corbyn as an individual), raises two fundamental questions. To put these
in the simplest way, “Why Mums?” and “Why Corbyn?”, or put more
precisely, if Mums4Corbyn is mothers organising with qualified autonomy
within Labour, why qualified?, or why autonomy? This can be clarified by
addressing the two broad alternatives to Mums4Corbyn and, finally by
addressing what it is that these alternatives share that limits them.

The first alternative, then, attached to “Why Mums?” is why organise
with any degree of autonomy within Labour (or the labour movement more
widely), why not organise merely as individuals within Labour, Momentum
or Trade Unions? What’s so special, politically, about being a mother?
Mothers, especially working class mothers have always been excluded from
the two dominant Labour traditions, the traditional limited
working-class politics of labourism on the one hand and the
middle-class, technocratic modernisation from above represented most
consistently by Fabianism. These at first may appear antagonistic, but
are, in fact, mutually dependent and, approaching them through the
question of motherhood, can precisely reveal this mutual dependence.
This exclusion of mothers is not contingent, nor accidental, it is
grounded in the deep structures of these traditions and, ultimately, in
their acceptance of a broadly subordinate position within British
capitalism.

Corbynism, to an extent (and this is part of “Why Corbyn?”), is a break
from these traditions. However, at present, both because of tendencies
internal to Corbynism and because of the deep institutional inertia of
the Labour Party apparatus, Corbynism only represents a qualified and
vulnerable break. Significantly more is required, whether in terms of
institutionalised party culture, or policy, or the general theoretical
attitude (and this is a theoretical attitude which is strongly
practically expressed and reproduced), for mothers to be included
adequately within the labour movement. This, and the range of positive
changes that go far beyond the interests of working class mothers
(whilst these interests are always necessarily central), justify the
need for mothers organising autonomously within the Labour Party.

Why Mothers?
------------

### Labourism

The ‘labourist’ tendency in the Labour Party has often excluded women
and struggles around reproduction, indeed it could be argued that it is
constituted, to an extent, by precisely this exclusion. This is because
this tendency stems from the importance of the organisation of a
particular section of the working class in the inception of the labour
movement and then how this privileging has been institutionally
reproduced along with the continuation, for some time, of its material
bases. Stuart Hall describes how this configuration organised
predominantly in workplaces and were formative in instituting the
movement’s political and cultural forms:

> For this skilled and semi-skilled manual working class stratum defined
> the dominant patterns of industrial unionism at a formative stage of
> the labour movement. It is also where the traditions of militancy and
> struggle are nurtured in the popular memory of the movement. It also
> defined the culture of the working class movement ([1982, p.
> 17](http://banmarchive.org.uk/collections/mt/pdf/82_11_16.pdf)).

Although they later describe how the politics of the miners strikes went
beyond their labourist tendencies, Hilary Wainwright and Doreen Massey
describe these communities, that were initially emblematic of this type
of politics, as

> Predominantly white; they are socially conservative; traditional
> sexual divisions of labour – woman as home-maker, man as bread-winner
> – have been deeply ingrained...Their politics have been
> workplace-based. They are the fiefdoms of one of the most important
> unions in labour movement history, symbolizing – at least for men –
> the old strengths of a solidarity born of mutual dependence at work,
> and the reliance of a whole community on a single industry...They are
> heartlands of labourism [^post-5-1].

It is not only that women were not subject to the politicisation of work
place struggles; they did have a role that included them in the social
whole of the wider world of labour through their, often strictly
policed, separation; that is, they were included by being excluded. As
Lise Vogel argues, capitalism is unique in “forc\[ing\] a severe
spatial, temporal, and institutional separation between domestic labour
and the capitalist production-process” [^post-5-2]. The separation of
domestic labour from wage labour means labourist struggles are strictly
separated from and do nothing to improve the conditions of women in the
spaces of reproductive labour. Moreover, this also means that the
traditional spaces of the acquisition of class consciousness, even as
women’s labour in the household worked to support labourist struggles
carried out largely by and for men, were alien both structurally and
experientially to the majority of women. As Hall acknowledges, “working
class unity and labour movement fraternity have often been underpinned
by certain versions of masculinity, traditionalism and domestic
respectability” ([1982, p.
19](http://banmarchive.org.uk/collections/mt/pdf/82_11_16.pdf)).

### Labour Modernisation

On the other hand, where the Labour Party has rejected these labourist
tendencies, such as in Fabianism and reaching the highest point of this
rejection in the New Labour era, it has predominantly done so as part of
an agenda which often deploys a critique (Hall) of “the patriarchalism
of leadership, hierarchy and authority which so strongly marks earlier
styles of political and industrial organisation” ([1982, p.
19](http://banmarchive.org.uk/collections/mt/pdf/82_11_16.pdf)) to
justify forms of modernisation from above. Here it is necessary to
distinguish the thrust and intention of Hall’s work from the (mis)use of
it by New Labour. Part of this move to modernise was based on the
understanding that labourism was an old-fashioned waning class politics
that no longer held any relevance or power in modern Britain. This was
because, as the working class was being recomposed in the final third of
the twentieth century, the material basis for ‘labourist’ political
forms was being dismantled. This lead occupational communities like the
miners to be viewed, in Wainwright and Massey’s words, as “‘old
fashioned’, sectional and, by implication, bankrupt. Male manual
workers, the old working class with a vengeance, fighting to save jobs
in what is officially described as a declining industry, state-owned and
located in isolated declining regions” [^post-5-3].

The lack of faith in the industrial and organisational strength of that
part of the class which had defined the movement in its labourist
formation meant, further, that any attempt to define purposes
oppositional to capital, it was felt, had to be relinquished. Labour
politics had to adapt itself to a pragmatic acquiescence to capitalist
purposes and accept the limitations imposed by a technocratic top-down
model of politics tinkering around the edges of, but ultimately not
challenging, the shift in power from labour to capital. Raymond Williams
explains in 1967 how

> The discussion about ‘modernized Britain’ is not about what sort of
> society, qualitatively, is being aimed at, but simply about how
> modernization is to be achieved. All programmes and perspectives are
> treated instrumentally. As a model of social change, modernization
> crudely foreshortens the historical development of society.
> Modernization is the ideology of the never-ending present. The whole
> past belongs to ‘traditional’ society, and modernization is a
> technical means for breaking with the past without creating a future”
> ([2013, p.
> 40](https://www.lwbooks.co.uk/sites/default/files/free-book/Mayday.pdf)).

For Silvia Federici, there is a symbiosis between the way a left
modernisation agenda views women and the Global South:

> In this sense, there is an immediate connection between the strategy
> the Left has for women and the strategy it has for the “Third
> World.”...In both cases they presume that the “underdeveloped”- those
> of us who are unwaged and work at a lower technological level- are
> backward with respect to the “real working class”...In both cases, the
> struggle which the Left offers to the wageless, the “underdeveloped,”
> is not a struggle against capitalism, but a struggle for capital, in a
> more rationalized, developed and productive form. In our case, they
> offer us not only the “right to work” (this they offer to every
> worker), but the right to work more [^post-5-4].

In New Labour, this analogous attempt to modernise in both international
and domestic policy can be seen in the justifications of the wars in
Iraq and, in particular in Afghanistan – as intervening on behalf of
women’s rights against a pre-modern backward society, and also in their
framing of withdrawal of support from women and families as offering a
way to advance women’s equality by ending their ‘dependence’. For
example, when Labour won office in 1997, they enacted the previous
Conservative government’s plans to cut income support. Supporting the
cuts to lone parent premium which she had previously opposed, Harriet
Harman called the impoverishment of single mothers, “[a pioneering
programme which marks a radical new approach to welfare, bringing work,
skills, opportunities and
ambition](https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=1997-07-28a.1.7)”.

That the political equality of women within a modernisation frame
ultimately runs alongside and articulates capitalist purposes, is,
explains Vogel, inevitable given its “material roots in capitalist
relations of production.” Vogel explains how “individual freedom” is
“bound to class-exploitation by the very logic of capitalist
reproduction” [^post-5-5]. Going back to Marx, this is because of the
need to free labour-power for exchange in the market, engendering that
double sense of freedom - that workers freely meet (not being bound by
feudal bondage or slavery) with the owners of the commodity, capital, to
sell their labour-power as a commodity, but also, that they are free
from other means of survival, forcing bearers of labour-power into the
exploitative conditions of production. As Vogel explains:

> Marx devoted considerable effort to showing that this exchange of
> equivalents ‘on the basis of equal rights’ of buyer and seller goes
> hand in hand with the exploitation characteristic of capitalist
> production. In the sphere of circulation, paradoxically, the
> requirements of the capitalist mode of production itself decrees that
> equality must reign [^post-5-6].

This does not mean struggles for political equality are futile; equality
is “a real tendency” [^post-5-7] carrying material effects, it does
mean, however, that equality in the sphere of circulation is compatible
with, and logically bound to, exploitation in the sphere of production.
While struggles to obtain equal rights and freedoms have the potential
to go beyond themselves because of their ability to organise the working
class; when posed in a modernisation frame that does not aim at the
transformation of society, it risks aiding “the perfection of the
conditions for the free sale of labour-power” [^post-5-8].

In this way, the Labour Party’s modernisation agenda has been ambiguous;
while transforming sexist discourse and increasing equal opportunities
both in the Party and wider society, introducing positive discrimination
in all-women short-lists and [at
work](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/2197691/Women-workers-to-get-positive-discrimination-rights.html),
this has gone hand in hand with removing the means of survival from
families precisely in order to end women’s dependence. This is based on
an understanding that views not only the Party and society as backward,
but women themselves, and is how a seemingly modernising liberal agenda
can go hand in hand with authoritarian interventions into those women
and their families who are resistant to change.

### The Division of Women's Lives from Politics

While seemingly at odds with one another, the labourist and modernising
tendencies in the Labour Party are in fact founded on the same sharp
separation of the every day lives and struggles of women from the
terrain of politics.

Labourist struggles taking place in predominantly male workplaces were
premised on the sexual division of labour and did little to directly
improve the conditions of women in the spaces of reproductive labour or
challenge sexist cultures and practices excluding women. So too,
modernising tendencies, while seeking to overcome the discrimination
that kept women away from the workplace, equally, did nothing to
transform the position of women in the household, or, for that matter,
their working conditions in production, with ‘women’s jobs’ often
repeating the conditions and undervaluation of their domestic role. A
‘modernising’ view that sees women’s domestic position improve as they
enter employment fails to see that it is “not the sex-division of labour
or the family per se – that materially underpins the perpetration of
women’s oppression and inequality in capitalist society” [^post-5-9].
Rather, as Susan Ferguson and David McNally write, summarising Vogel’s
argument,

> The socio-material roots of women’s oppression under capitalism have
> to do instead with the structural relationship of the household to the
> reproduction of capital: capital and the state need to be able to
> regulate their biological capacity to produce the next generation of
> labourers so that labour-power is available for exploitation
> [^post-5-10].

Federici critiques the Left in its modernising mode for

> \[Translating\] their ignorance of the specific relation of women to
> capital into a theory of women’s political backwardness to be overcome
> only by our entering the factory gates. Thus, the logic of an analysis
> that sees women’s oppression as caused by the exclusion from
> capitalist relations inevitably results in a strategy for us to enter
> these relations rather than destroy them [^post-5-11].

In this way, working class mothers are central to capitalism; exploited
as direct producers in the sphere of production, as working class men
are, but also, subject to the functional disciplining of men on
capital’s behalf to ensure they fulfil they’re role in social
reproduction. That is, the reproduction of that ‘special commodity’
labour power, which is the source of the capitalist’s profit, and which,
in turn, links women to the work of wider domestic labour of daily
maintenance and care, which, uniquely in capitalism, is spatially,
temporally and institutionally separated from other processes of labour,
in private households.

Standing at the sharp end of these contradictions between production and
reproduction in capitalism means working class mothers have a unique
standpoint from which to understand and struggle against it – something
which is often a necessity, not a choice. This echoes what Lukács writes
about the standpoint of the proletarian:

For the proletarian the total knowledge of its class-situation was a
vital necessity, a matter of life and death; because its class situation
becomes comprehensible only if the whole of society can be understood;
and because this understanding is the inescapable precondition of its
actions. Thus the unity of theory and practice is only the reverse side
of the social and historical position of the proletariat. From its own
point of view, self-knowledge coincides with knowledge of the whole so
that the proletariat is at one and the same time the subject and object
of its knowledge [^post-5-12].

Mothers, similarly, understand their situation under capitalism. We know
how difficult it is to meet the requirements of a job and find time to
care for our children. We, especially if we are lone mothers, know how
hard it is to make ends meet on a wage that undervalues our work and can
never cover the costs of raising children. It is this necessity, as
various pieces in our Motherhood series will show, that not only means
mothers grasp their situation theoretically, but that this grasping can
confront it, practically, as “a matter of life and death” for us and our
children. This may be a question of struggling for access to the means
of survival, for example, against housing benefit cuts (and their
eugenicist intentions and implications), it may be direct confrontation
over housing, as in Mary Barbour’s army and the Glasgow rent strike; it
may be, armed with this understanding, for radical innovations as in
Alexandra Kollantai’s vision for a network of children’s centres; it may
be for the proper resourcing of care work or better support for feeding
babies. But it may go beyond the limits of demanding state resources,
whether this is in communal struggles against loneliness or against the
targeting of children by police and the judicial system, all of which
are explored in our series.

Why Labour?
-----------

### Corbyn and the new ‘New Left’

Corbyn has provided an opportunity to move beyond the labourist and
modernising tendencies of the Labour Party, taking up some of the
demands of mother’s struggles to address these issues from an expanded
site of politics. On a policy level this may include a commitment to
forms of rent control, making access to the means of survival more
affordable, or, more speculatively, as documented in the *Alternative
Models of Ownership* report, to developing forms of economic democracy
whereby the struggles of everyday life and of reproduction can impact on
and even determine production.

In this way, Corbyn is bringing to bear on the Party today some of the
New Left struggles he was a part of in the 1980s. As Wainwright examines
in Labour: A Tale of Two Parties, the efforts of the socialist feminists
did a great deal to extend the appeal of the Party beyond male sectional
interests, and extend the sites of politics beyond workplaces. In taking
up the insights of socialist feminism, the New Left was also able to go
beyond Labour’s technocratic Fabian tendencies, with Wainwright
explaining that, for the women’s sections within Labour,

> The liberation of women is not a matter of political equality alone.
> Unless women also have economic independence, and control over their
> own bodies and sexuality, unless child care and other domestic work is
> reorganised, then women will still, whatever their formal rights, be
> subordinate. This approach frequently leads the new women’s sections
> to work with groups of women involved in social, community and
> economic issues which the rest of the party, left and right, does not
> consider ‘political’ [^post-5-13].

Through this approach, although met with resistance, women were able to
expand the sites of political struggle beyond work-places and
production. Labourism saw the “factory, office or enterprise” as “a
black box with the value of labour power going in one end, and surplus
value coming out of the other”, and viewed politics as a “confrontation
between sectional interests” [^post-5-14] over the spoils; while
Labour’s technocratic tendency accepted capital’s victory for these
spoils and concentrated its efforts on the ‘efficiency’ of the process,
hoping that this would persuade capital to trickle down its wealth.
Here, then, the labourist and the technocratic tendency can be shown to
be mutually dependent. Both the kinds of processes of social
reproduction required to produce ‘the value of labour power’ as well as
what went on inside the ‘black box’, which was a site of struggle taken
up by 1980s New Unionism and other parts of the Labour left, were
politicised, addressing the concerns of women, both as the new workers
of capitalism and within households as primary carers, and, often, now
performing the ‘double shift’.

However, Corbyn’s readoption of these struggles in the Labour Party
today have not gone far enough. For example, rent controls, for
Williams, by aiming to “take rents out of politics”, were opaque, hard
to enforce and based on a compromise between the interests of landlord
and tenant, compared to the rigid, clear forms under the Wilson
government. This lead William’s to complain that “the government has
sacrificed many of those most in need of protection” ([2013, p.
24](https://www.lwbooks.co.uk/sites/default/files/free-book/Mayday.pdf))).
Even more tellingly and obviously for the lives of mothers, Labour’s
existing childcare policies risk a slide into technocracy and the more
efficient meeting of the needs of capitalist society rather than the
expansive, democratic and co-operative implications that could be drawn
out from the *Alternative Models of Ownership* report.

Organising as Mums4Corbyn means that, in the same ways as women’s
sections did as part of the New Left in the 1980s, we can push the
potential of this break in a way that other alternatives cannot.

### Liberal and Anarchist Alternatives

The alternatives pull in two directions, one that can be characterised
as broadly ‘liberal’, one as broadly ‘anarchist’. Both these tendencies
would respond to the very clear limits of Labour as it stands when it
comes to women, and particularly mothers, by organising independently of
Labour.

From the liberal perspective this would mean accepting the broad
categories of the state and parliamentarianism with all its mediations
(all its mediations perhaps except for political parties), and organise
around awareness raising and lobbying of MPs and government to improve
policies and cultural understanding of the issues faced by motherhood.

From the anarchist perspective, this would mean an absolute refusal of
the state and its mediations, favouring grassroots organising of mothers
both to challenge the state directly, for example, over Labour councils’
“gatekeeping” practices with housing support, or organising to directly
meet mothers’ needs without any state mediation.

The first response to this is to point to the pure numbers involved in
Labour, even in terms of the direct meeting of needs, a Party of
hundreds of thousands of members with a significant presence in almost
every community is potentially (but only potentially, the struggles of
“Why Mums?” are key to realising this potential) a formidable weapon.

Secondly, Corbynism - at least those tendencies within it which break
with labourism and technocracy - is at least potentially porous to
social movement organisation as it was in the 80s New Left, which Corbyn
was a part of:

> Many individuals from the new left, the left that both initiated and
> were attracted to the party by the reform movement in the last
> seventies...learnt from the tactics and of mass movements like CND,
> the women’s movement and black community politics. This persuasive,
> outward-going kind of politics is particularly clear in the behaviour
> of the new breed of MP and parliamentary candidate: Jeremy Corbyn in
> Islington [^post-5-15].

This porosity to social movements can be a means to challenge those
entrenched interests and practices hostile to working class mothers
within the Party itself. Moreover, a Party, which is already in
government in Wales, already runs local councils across the country and
which is potentially the next government in Westminster, and which is
potentially radically transformed and democratised- a potential only
unevenly met at present, will be a valuable instrument for unifying
theory and practice, for bringing the experiences and struggles of
mothers to bear on policy in a way which can transform lives beyond
heroic local efforts at organising for survival.

The rejection of the anarchist perspective on autonomous organising can
only be made good on if the Party is transformed beyond its mutually
dependent labourism and technocracy, that is, by responding to the
pressures enacted in the “Why Mums?” side of the question. Ultimately,
moreover, both potential critiques of “Why Mums?” and “Why Corbyn?” rely
on a sometimes implicit, sometimes explicit set of separations which are
fundamental to capitalist society, these are the strict separations
between politics, the economy (and a further separation between
production and reproduction, a separation which occludes reproduction)
and a third term, which could be denoted by community, culture, if
culture is broadly understood, or everyday life. Labourism and Fabianism
are mutually dependent, for example, within Labour with the idea
labourist struggles take care of the economy and Fabian managerialism
takes care of politics, liberal autonomism, privileges purely a narrowly
understood idea of politics and a vague and narrow notion of culture,
whilst the anarchist critique entirely centres struggles in the economy
of everyday life. Ultimately, the standpoint of working class mothers
can unfold a perspective that unifies these sites against capitalism and
the state in all its dimensions.
