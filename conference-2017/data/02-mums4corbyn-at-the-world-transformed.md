Mums4Corbyn at the World Transformed
====================================

*New Socialist* are very happy to announce details of our comrades and
collaborators, Mums4Corbyn's events at [The World
Transformed](https://theworldtransformed.org/) on Saturday 23rd
September.

‘Mumrades’ - rise up! The inequality faced by women in society is often
linked to our role as mothers and carers. Women are not only lower paid
than men but our labour in the home goes unpaid, and this double burden
also contributes to the underrepresentation of women in politics. So
what are we going to do about it? Mums4Corbyn will be addressing this
question and unpacking the demands that self-identifying women can and
should be making in and outside the Labour Party to end inequality. Come
and tell us what your demands are as we prepare our Mums4Corbyn charter.

Home Truths: Housing is a Feminist Issue (11.00 - 13.00)
--------------------------------------------------------

Whether spending a higher proportion of their earnings on rent or being
more likely to be affected by the bedroom tax, women are hit hardest by
the housing crisis. Now more than ever, housing is a feminist issue.
Join us to talk about the impact of the housing crisis on women and how
we organise the fight-back.

Line-up:

-   Dawn Foster (*Guardian* Journalist)
-   Daisy-May Hudson (Film-maker with Experience of Homelessness)
-   Yvette Williams (Justice for Grenfell)
-   Chaired by Samiah Anderson

Radical Demands From the Grassroots (13.00 - 15.00)
---------------------------------------------------

From the vote to wages for housework, women have always been getting
organised and making radical demands on society as well as in their own
movements. These demands often shine light on areas long-ignored by
otherwise progressive movements and, most importantly, force radical
change. What demands should women be making today, and how do we realise
these demands? In answering these questions, we’ll be taking inspiration
from movements past and present, including the Black Panthers.

Line-up:

-   Shami Chakrabarti
-   Maya Goodfellow
-   English Collective of Prostitutes
-   Vanessa Olorenshaw

Childcare (15.00 - 17.00)
-------------------------

What does a better, more radical approach to childcare look like?
Mums4corbyn will be in conversation with Tracy Brabin, shadow minister
for early years discussing this topic.

A study from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
found that Childcare costs in the U.K. are the highest in the world and
yet childcare professionals are some of the lowest paid. A survey by
Mumsnet and the Resolution Foundation found that those mothers on the
lowest incomes who are wanting to take on extra hours are prevented from
doing so due to the cost of childcare. Finding childcare that fits
around the reality of women's lives is increasingly difficult and the
quality of childcare and state subsidies is piecemeal. Parents know
there has to be something better than what is currently on offer.

Lineup:

In conversation with Tracy Brabin (Shadow Minister for Early Years),
Andrea Marie (*New Socialist* Theory and Strategy co-editor), Selma
James and Camille Barbagallo. Chaired by Momentum Kids co-founder
Natasha Josette.
