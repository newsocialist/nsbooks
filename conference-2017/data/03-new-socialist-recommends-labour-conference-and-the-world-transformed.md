New Socialist recommends... at Labour Conference and The World Transformed
==========================================================================

Navigating the vast programme of fringe events, debates, parties and
floor discussions taking place in and around Labour Party Conference and
The World Transformed can be a pretty overwhelming exercise,
particularly for those attending either event for the first time. With
this in mind *New Socialist* has prepared its own select programme of
recommended events, with a particular emphasis on events that align with
our aims and those involving key figures from the left of the party and
the wider movement.

The *New Socialist* programme covers proceedings on the conference
floor, ‘official’ fringe events and those at The World Transformed,
where [*New Socialist’s*
event](https://theworldtransformed.org/sessions/corbynism-from-below/)
is taking place. As such many of these require either a conference pass
or a TWT pass - our listings clearly list these entry requirements.
These recommendations do not necessarily represent an endorsement of the
hosts of each event or all the panellists. Unfortunately due to the
wealth of exciting events on offer many of those we recommend clash.

Several *New Socialist* editors and contributors will be in Brighton and
we hope to see you there. [](http://)

**Key** (LP) - requires conference pass (TWT) - requires The World
Transformed Pass (OTA) - open to all

*For the full timetable for proceedings on the conference floor see

listings [here](http://labourconference.org/#fringe_select.html) and the
