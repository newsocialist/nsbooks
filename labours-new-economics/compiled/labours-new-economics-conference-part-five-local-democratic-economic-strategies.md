Andrew Gwynne, Shadow Secretary of State, Communities & Local Government
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Andrew Gwynne, chairing the session, noted that we can’t wait until the
next Labour government to provide relief from austerity and that there
is a clear role for local government. This helps open up the questions
of local democratic economic strategies on four levels.

1.  (What Gwynne was referring to) What can Labour councils do now with
    existing powers and within quite serious given constraints, and also
    what role the movement, in its current state can play both in
    pressurising councils and carrying out aspects of a programme.
2.  What sort of movement do we need to build both to nurture and
    pressure for a wider, more radical practice around local democratic
    ownership and to carry this out.
3.  What does a Labour government have to do nationally to empower
    councils more generally to carry out these programmes.
4.  To reverse the terms of the question, what local practices could be
    scaled up to national level.

Matthew Brown, Preston City Council
-----------------------------------

Matthew Brown began the session proper with a discussion of the “Preston
Model”, starting with the opening of the new municipally owned market
and the announcement of Labour’s new Community Wealth Building Unit. He
went to give both the national and, indeed international, as well as the
local context for what has happened in Preston.

For Brown, Labour’s interest in community wealth building is part of,
following a claim from Jeremy Corbyn, politics finally catching up with
the 2008 crash and its implications. For Brown both 2008 and its
aftermath represents a systemic failure, most notably in the post-crash
attempts of macro-economic policy to desperately prop up an obviously
unviable system. In terms of the specific Preston context, the most
important event was the final abandonment by in 2011 of the £780 million
Tithebarn city centre regeneration project (for comrades in Haringey and
Southwark, the villainous role of Lend Lease will be notable). The
failure of this conventional capitalist, developer-led regeneration
project forced a radical improvisation.

Brown then outlined the main features of the model

-   The anchor strategy- the encouragement of major local institutions
    like the hospital and university that are rooted in Preston (while
    capital is mobile, some institutions are not) to spend more of their
    budgets locally.
-   Use of local government pension funds, £100 million is now invested
    locally.
-   Using council procurement- “procurement is more interesting than you
    think”- to support co-ops, including farming co-ops and IT co-op for
    university graduates (it’s worth noting here that it’s not just
    capital that is sucked into London and the South East but people).
-   Building a Community Bank
-   Establishing a housing development company and co-operative energy
    company, the latter in conjunction with other Lancashire councils.

Brown continued, pointing to examples from the USA that suggest the
possibility of doing some of this on a greater scale. The Bank of North
Dakota has 70% of citizens’ savings deposits and this cushioned the
impact of 2008 much more than in other US states. Alabama has
successfully shifted pension investments towards local investment, which
not only proved socially useful but has provided more stable returns.

Brown concluded by noting (and this would be part of what I’ve described
as “[hard
predistribution](https://newsocialist.org.uk/labours-new-economics-conference-part-four-co-operatives-session/)”)
the egalitarian tendencies in the model, with Preston now having the
lowest percentage of workers paid less than the living wage in
Lancashire. Brown also regretted how far local government is presented
as managerial and limited.

Heather Wakefield, UNISON
-------------------------

Wakefield echoed Brown’s conclusion, noting that particularly given the
post-2010 tightening constraints on local government, Labour in local
government has not felt transformative. However, even in the context of
the limits placed on local government there are aspects of the situation
that can be worked on. 64p in every pound spent by local government goes
into the local economy, at least in the first instance, which gives
considerable potential power through procurement. Potentially even more
significantly, outside London, 60% of the council workforce live in the
local authority area, earning and spending money locally and using
services, this gives them an overlapping set of interests in their towns
or cities.

These overlapping interests in a place also bear on the spatial
implications of exploitation of council workers, particularly those
whose jobs are outsourced. Underpayment of workers, for example in care
workers not being paid for travel time, not only deprives them of money
they should be receiving, but sucks money in the form of profits for
shareholders that should be decent wages being spent locally out of the
area. A similar leaking is present in pension funds: pensions are
deferred pay, which could be invested locally, but instead security in
retirement is mediated through various forms of speculative investment.
In addition to this loss of potential investment, the capital in pension
funds is not subject to democratic or ethical oversight, often being
used for arms production or trade or bolstering environmental
destruction. What all this amounts to is a situation where workers are
alienated from where they live and from each other.

Wakefield went on to identify a number of issues or challenges in
building local democratic economic structures:

-   The necessary central role of workers and trade unions alongside the
    need to democratise unions.
-   The need to transform local government industrial relations systems
    so that they become more than merely a means of managing cuts.
-   With local government playing a central role, issues of
    representation, especially the under-representation of women in
    councils need to be addressed, including through developing more
    participatory democratic forms.

Ted Howard, Democracy Collaborative
-----------------------------------

Howard began by talking of the “pilgrimage” from the USA to Preston, and
how Preston had now eclipsed what had been achieved in the US. He then
outlined the principles of Community Wealth Building.

-   The priority of labour over capital, particularly in a crisis, with
    continued stable employment more important than capital’s profits.
-   The need for local and broad-based rather than absentee ownership,
    as the basis for asserting what interests are valued.
-   The importance of active democratic ownership contrasted with the
    passive, consumer model of neoliberalism.
-   The central role for multipliers and internalising the circulation
    of money with investment sticking rather than capital being
    extracted.
-   Economic development understood not as a partnership between the
    state and business, in which the state is unaccountable and
    subordinate, but as a multistakeholder process.
-   Place matters, direct investment in neighbourhoods, particularly
    neighbourhoods of colour is necessary, trickle down particularly
    into these neighbourhoods cannot be relied upon.
-   Systemic change, the current system destroys the environment and
    produces inequalities so it’s necessary to move beyond amelioration
    to build systems that produce different outcomes.

Howard concluded, with the properly Marxist-humanist insight, “people
made our systems, we can remake them” (or, “[if there’s been a way to
build it, there’ll be a way to destroy it, things are not all that out
of control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlonpJ6c814)”).

Questions, Challenges, Extensions
---------------------------------

The session was extremely encouraging, especially alongside the
announcement in the week before of Labour’s Community Wealth Building
Unit. The following points are intended less as criticism, more as areas
where further exploration may be useful. These questions range from
considering how far a struggle within Labour may be necessary to spread
the model to how unique is Preston and therefore what aspects could be
generalised to what sort of unions might we need to develop and
implement programmes to what could a Labour government nationally do to
expand on possibilities for local democratic economic strategies. The
piece concludes with a brief consideration of the 1985 GLC London
Industrial Strategy [^chapter-20-1] as an exemplary local democratic
economic strategy to suggest that, long-term, we need to be thinking
about what it would it take to get us to a point where versions equal to
its scope and radicalism were possible in all kinds of different areas.

Generalising the Preston Model?
-------------------------------

If there could be an area of criticism, however, it could be in a slight
vagueness about the political struggles necessary to generalise
something like the Preston Model to other Labour councils. Questions
were posed from the room, particularly in the wake of struggles in
Haringey, over the role of party members in pushing for policies like
those in Preston and countering possible resistance from sitting
councillors, but these were brushed off by both Gwynne and Brown, with
Brown suggesting “a friendly debate about ideas” may be all that’s
required. Of course, there are relatively sensible pragmatic reasons for
not attacking existing Labour councils in this sort of forum and,
largely, the transformation of local councils is the task of local
members. Moreover, although it seems likely that the Community Wealth
Building model probably requires imaginative left leadership able to
grasp and be responsive to local needs while not accepting the narrow
constraints of existing capitalism particularly in its spatial impacts,
there is no reason why its drawing together of communities and obvious
practical orientation shouldn’t be able to draw in other sections of the
Party. Here, a certain impatience with factional concerns whilst
retaining the attentiveness to local needs and practically oriented
critique of capitalism may well be a prudent part of a hegemonic
strategy. However, the importance of developing a radical movement
including one that pushes imaginative people on the left (and Howard
emphasised that there is an important role for visionary leadership in
community wealth building) into leadership positions.

Relatedly, and overlapping with some of these concerns over generalising
the model, the question needs to be asked: how specific is Preston? Why
has it not (yet?) been imitated to any great degree? Here, there may be
a range of geographical, economic and political issues that intersect
and reinforce each other. Equally, then, the question could be posed,
what adaptations would be required to do Community Wealth Building in a
larger city, a London borough, or London as a whole, or a rural area, or
on the level of a devolved government- what would such a strategy look
like in Wales?

One major factor, of course, in building broad support was desperation
after the cancelling of the regeneration project, and Brown commented
that was exceptionally easy, as a result, to bring anchor institutions
into the project. Preston is certainly not unique in terms of failed,
capitalist regeneration projects but this certainly is a major factor in
allowing space for improvisation. A more general point could perhaps be
made here, drawing on Neil Smith’s notion of the Catch-22 of
gentrification (places that have suffered long periods of disinvestment
need significant investment but the cost of that investment is greater
integration into capitalism, social cleansing and destruction of
communities [^chapter-20-2]) or to slightly transform the saying, is the
misery greater in a place capitalism wants to exploit or in one it does
not want to? This bears on the political aspect of the question too:
would a place that capital had more interest in (and this doesn’t
necessary mean a rich place; big capital has, for example, a greater
interest in Liverpool than Preston) have been able to develop the model
without interference, including interference mediated through Labour
councillors? Finally, for the specificity of Preston, would the model
work (or what adaptations be required) in a larger city, or in a
impoverished but widely dispersed rural area? As Wakefield argued,
London boroughs may lack the majority of people with the overlapping
interests in a place that come from working and living, and therefore,
relying on services, there. Furthermore, do anchor institutions operate
in a similarly rooted way in a larger city, or are they less reliant on
the well-being of their surrounding area as a whole? Perhaps a final
critical point that merits investigation would surround how does Preston
stand not only in global and national capitalism but how does the
strategy relate to its neighbours. On the one hand, projects like a
Lancashire Community Bank, would probably, depending on control and the
allocation of investment benefit neighbouring areas as would support for
food co-ops with the rural hinterland, one the other, however, how far
does the attempt to root capital in Preston damage surrounding areas?
Stopping a leaking of resources to London and the South East or even to
international capitalism is one thing, stopping a “leaking” of resources
to Blackburn quite another.

As Wakefield suggested, and the point was developed in a question by
Hilary Wainwright, a further question about generalisation surrounds
what kind of trade unions are required. Wainwright offered a further
principle to add to Howard’s that is clearly vital to projects of local
democratic ownership and control, around the necessity to mobilise
popular knowledge. This clearly then poses the question of how this
knowledge is to be organised and made effective, particularly as it is
often tacit, embodied in practice, rather than explicit and this poses
the question of what kind of trade unions would be necessary to support
or even lead this role when it comes to the knowledge of workers. There
is also a further question when it comes, for example, to pension funds,
which was signalled by Wakefield, that traditional economistic
calculations by unions (and the beleaguered state of British trade
unionism, given forty years of defeat, certainly adds to these
conformist pressures) would challenge (and, it should be added would
probably be consciously worked on by capital) efforts to redeploy
pensions towards useful local investment, particularly in areas where
the overlapping interests in place do not exist, and towards the
centring of ethical, peace and ecological considerations. The stability
argument may, as with Alabama, have a bit of purchase, but without a
trade union movement which goes beyond an immediate, narrow calculation
of workers’ interests- in this case in maximising returns of pensions-
may well not be enough. One could add to Howard’s observation that this
going beyond would require union members having space to act less as
consumers of a service from a union, more as active, knowledgeable
participants. The question of pension funds may also be key beyond local
government as they offer significant resources for useful and ethical
investment on a national level.

The next area of investigation would be around precisely what Labour
needs to do on a national level to empower and resource councils to
develop the local democratic economic agenda. Brown mentioned US
councils being able to mandate living wages and bans on payday lenders,
and both of these moves as well as being ethically sound also have a
spatial implication, with more money to be spent in communities rather
than leaking out through profits squeezed through underpayment or
extraction of interest. Powers to mandate living wages and ban payday
lenders, however, would only be part of the task.

Lessons from the GLC Industrial Strategy
----------------------------------------

It might be useful to conclude by looking at the 1985 GLC London
Industrial Strategy, which Wainwright mentioned, not, as she said,
“nostalgically” but as a document that suggests what local democratic
planning and control could look like, with a view to thinking about what
doing something along these lines would take both in terms of the
actions of local government, powers and resources provided by central
government and in terms of what sort of movement building would be
necessary.

On looking at the strategy, the most immediately striking thing is the
huge range of sectors covered, including some that still seem obviously
part of what a council should be doing (even if here powers are
increasingly limited) like transport and planning for development, “The
People’s Plan for the Royal Docks”, to other areas of the economy where
it now would be remarkable today to see central, let alone, local
government planning, such as furniture, vehicle manufacture, clothing
and printing, to areas still not really treated by dominant opinion and
practice as economic like domestic work, to areas that challenge and aim
to transform the city in an international context, attentiveness to
global supply chains and the major chapter on arms conversion.

The two perhaps guiding assertions of the document—both of which would
be contested, if even acknowledged, by dominant opinion today—are the
centrality of planning, particularly in individual sectors, “detailed
sectoral planning can generate feasible, cost-effective and socially
beneficial strategies for employment growth” (p. 19) and the central
role of popular participation, “the strength of the sector strategies is
that they have been subject to consultation and refinement in the light
of experience” (p. 21). This establishes planning not as the technique
of narrowly defined specialists in obedience to “economic laws” but as
an on-going, collective, political, conscious, and
consciousness-developing, process (as with much of the new economics
agenda it is, in a sense, prefigurative, or at very least the means
cultivates capacities that are necessary to the ends).

Notable too, on the level of conceptuality, often, but not always, tacit
rather than theoretically articulated, is the wider spatial sense of the
city in the world and challenges to the taken for granted spatial splits
of capitalism ("Capitalism’s drive to increase surplus-value by
enhancing productivity...forces a severe spatial, temporal, and
institutional separation between domestic labour and the capitalist
production-process"[^chapter-20-3]). The city economy, therefore,
involves both the international and the domestic, two areas
conventionally excluded. This is particularly apparent, especially
because the intellectualism fostered by the processes of the women’s
movement means that the claims are theoretically articulated, in the
chapter on and the strategy’s general understanding of the domestic.
This includes a set of challenges through the experiences theorised in
the women’s movement to dominant understandings, and the possibilities
of a practical challenge to things as they stand,

> Work performed in the house, usually by women, is unpaid and largely
> unrecognised. But it makes an important contribution to the economy
> and affects how wealth and work for wages is distributed...the
> boundaries between the tasks that are performed privately in the home
> and those that are publicly provided or communally performed are not
> fixed. In the 1920s there were radical versions of communal
> organisation of daily life (p. 195).

The domestic, however, is not only included as one sector among others
in the GLC’s politics of production (perhaps it would be better to say
production and reproduction), but figures as the starting point of
consideration, “for an economics geared to need the household is the
starting point” (p. 19). Attention to the domestic a major lever for
opening wider questions, grounded in the strategies developed by the
women’s movement, involving,

> Extension of the sharing of domestic work and caring: within the
> household, between households, through extended public provision;
> linking public provision (particularly of childcare, and care for the
> elderly) to the needs of women as wage workers; further reducing
> women’s total working time by improved transport and communications,
> and the decentralisation of public services and shops; changing the
> structure of wage employment to allow for a better integration between
> wage work and domestic care. (p. 21)

As suggested by this particular attention to the domestic and women’s
oppression, both in the home and in its impacts in waged work, the GLC
strategy is attentive to inequalities and forms of oppression more
widely, particularly of race (there are affinities here with some of
Howard’s remarks on community wealth building against the extraction of
resources or non-resourcing of neighbourhoods of colour). The strategy
notes disproportionately high unemployment of Black youth (p. 6),
creating strategies to develop the power of Bengali clothing workers to
challenge discrimination and oppression (p. 137) and particularly
focusing interventions in training and childcare on part-time cleaners,
who the strategy notes were disproportionately Black women (p. 460).

Spatial questions also implicate how does the local exist within both
the global division of labour and imperialist militarism with the
strategy attending, on a local level to both global supply chains and
arms conversion in a way that should inspire the fleshing out work
nationally as well as locally. The GLC strategy, for example, is far in
advance of Labour nationally at present on global supply chains and,
particularly, on what is now described as defence diversification, with
the limitedness of British trade unionism a significant factor in the
lack of much of the latter thus far in Corbynism. The GLC strategy, for
example, proposes “the GLC will seek to set up links with clothing
providers in the progressive countries of the Third World who provide
good quality, unionised employment, and will seek to increase trade
between London firms and these enterprises” (p. 137). Learning from this
and applying it in the circumstances of 2018 would require an ethical
and imaginative procurement strategy would be key, and this would
require a major challenge to government proposals to ban councils (and
not only councils) from [divesting on ethical
grounds](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/israel-boycott-local-councils-public-bodies-and-student-unions-to-be-banned-from-shunning-israeli-a6874006.html),
if these are restarted following the Palestine Solidarity Campaign's
[successful
challenge](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/26/israel-palestine-bds-campaign-judicial-review)-
the focus has been on opposing BDS but it extends far more widely. The
establishment of non-exploitative trading relations is also part of the
arms conversion strategy within a critique of government aid programmes
that support arms trading and the

> Creat\[ion\] of a market for over-priced and uncompetitive British
> goods, especially when, as is often the case, such exports are for
> purposes of dubious relevance to real needs in the Third World, or may
> actually be harmful.” (p. 300)

The whole agenda whether considering Preston today or London in the
1980s has to have this strong spatial sense around where the local
stands in flows of capital, and what it can do about them, and it is
perhaps the specifically spatial thought and practice that gives these
models their anti-capitalist character and their usefulness.

Finally, there is the theoretical radicalism that brings together all
these considerations into general principles for a politics of
production. The strategy rejects not only monetarism but Keynesianism
particularly because of their focus on national markets and consequent
indifference towards the local and to production, let alone to the
domestic (p. 59-60). Instead, general principles of a politics of
production are set out, which potentially offer a great deal to
imagining what a strategy for local democratic economic development
might entail.

-   An emphasis on long term strategic production planning of
    industries;
-   a concern that restructuring in all sectors of the economy should be
    carried out in the interests of those who work in the industry and
    use its products;
-   a commitment to the development and application of human centred
    technology;
-   a strategic concern with improving the conditions and hours of work
    in the domestic economy, and with improved means of integrating
    domestic work with other parts of the economy in order to improve
    the living and working conditions of women;
-   a priority to extending social control over the public economy
    through increasing political, trade union and user control;
-   a commitment to popular involvement in all aspects of strategic
    policy making (popular planning) and in the operation of enterprises
    (enterprise planning).

Clearly we are a long way from being able to formulate let alone
implement a contemporary version of the GLC’s industrial strategy, it
would require the development of and extension of powers and capacities
both legal and institutional and cultural-political in the broadest
possible sense. However, exploring what it might take to get to such a
place and what can be began now would certainly be worth attention.
