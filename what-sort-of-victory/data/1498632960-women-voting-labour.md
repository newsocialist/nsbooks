Women Voting Labour: The Politics of Constructing the Unity of a Class
======================================================================

**or Rebuilding the Labour Movement for Social Reproduction**

by Andrea Marie

Women voted for Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party in greater numbers than
men, according to research by
[YouGov](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2017/06/13/how-britain-voted-2017-general-election/)
conducted with 50,000 people after the election. To put this in context,
with only the support of the 39 per cent of men who this research
suggests voted Labour, a Conservative majority of 30 would have been
delivered on 8th June; with a 43 per cent share of women’s vote, the
Tories would have been 20 seats short of an overall majority and Labour
could have formed a minority government.

While women choose to vote Labour for a myriad of reasons in a diverse
range of circumstances, they do so within the wider historical, social,
economic and political context, and, as such, as Stuart Hall suggests
when writing about labour movement support, it is important to
“recognise the changes, the emergent patterns” ([p.
19](http://banmarchive.org.uk/collections/mt/pdf/82_11_16.pdf)). By
examining women’s recent voting behaviour in the UK, I want to suggest a
theoretical framework, drawing on New Left theorists such as Hall,
Hilary Wainwright and Doreen Massey, whose work often made use of
certain observations in Raymond Williams, through which these choices
can be interpreted.

Williams is key because he not only realised at the time of writing *The
Long Revolution* in 1961 what many analysts fail to take account of
today – the significance of gender as well as class, or, to modify Hall,
gender as a modality in which class is lived, in grasping voting
behaviour and political consciousness more generally, but also because
of his tentative steps to understand what processes underlie this. Even
where gender is mentioned, as for example by the [*Daily Telegraph‘s*
report](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/29/women-likely-vote-labour/)
predicting that women would vote for Corbyn in greater numbers than men,
there is no effort to inquire why. When commenting on the well-known
phenomenon of working class support for the Tories, Williams sees that
gender differences illustrate the incompleteness of typical ways of
understanding and analysing politics:

> Millions of wage-earners and their wives still vote Conservative, as
> in previous elections. The significant questions are what kinds of
> people these are, and whether there are any new and permanent social
> patterns shaping them. It is difficult to answer these questions with
> any certainty, but one fact stands out. The division of voters by sex
> cuts right across the usual analysis by class, introducing questions
> which cannot be negotiated within our ordinary political
> categories.[^post-29-1]

This is crucial because it disrupts some of the dominant narratives
around class and voting behaviour which ignore gender and, in so doing,
suggest short-termist electoral strategies that appeal to a cultural
sense of class rather than addressing the popular needs of working class
women and men today. This tendency stems from the importance of the
organised working class (and this was the organisation of a particular
section of the working class) in the inception of the labour movement;
however, it fails to understand how this movement was built at a
specific historical conjuncture in capitalist society and, consequently,
reifies the link between this particular section of the working class
and the party as a whole.

In contrast, as Wainwright examines in *Labour: A Tale of Two Parties*,
the movement has never just been reducible to these ‘labourist’
tedencies, but has encompassed – and is still encompassing – a great
variety of participation and activism, including from women. The efforts
of the New Left in the 80s, particularly socialist feminists, did a
great deal to extend the appeal of the party beyond male sectional
interests, and extend the sites of politics beyond workplaces to address
women’s social and economic, as well as political, needs. This was in
stark contrast to Thatcher’s neoliberal agenda which, I will argue,
drawing substantially on Lise Vogel and Nancy Fraser, initiated a
redrawing of the boundaries between the spheres of production and
reproduction that disinvested the social fabric and made substantial
areas of provisioning the responsibility of women at a time when they
were also being drawn into the labour force in increasing numbers. This
is the backdrop against which New Labour won in 1997 on an agenda of
modernisation and, after a decade of austerity, perhaps parallels can be
drawn with Labour’s surprise success in 2017, with both having been made
possible by their appeal to women. However, although breaking with the
Party’s labourist tendencies was a prerequisite for both successes, the
way in which both incarnations of the Party have made use of the
socialist feminist influence as part of the 80s New Left, is starkly
different, with only the promise of the Labour Party today having the
will and, potentially, the capacity to honour its legacy.

Women’s Voting Behaviour
------------------------

The way women voted in this election is part of a [wider
trend](https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/how-britain-voted-october-1974)
of women being more likely to vote Labour and less likely to vote
Conservative than men since 2005, with the previous elections from 1987
(with the interesting exception of 1992) seeing women and men vote both
Conservative and Labour in roughly the same proportions. This, however,
is a significant recent change, reversing the trend that saw, before
1987, women voting Conservative in greater numbers than men and being
less likely to vote Labour.

![Voting patterns by gender, Ipsos-MORI, February
2015](/Users/joe/Projects/nsbooks/what-sort-of-victory/data/votegender.png)
*[Source: Voting patterns by gender, Ipsos MORI, February
2015](https://www.ncpolitics.uk/2015/03/history-voting-patterns-gender.html/)*

Williams’ far-sighted analysis saw the reversal in men and women’s
voting behaviour approaching as far back as the early 60s:

> This male Labour majority has been normal since the war, though it is
> also significant that it narrowed during the fifties, and that the
> Conservative majority among women has also been narrowing. The
> reasons, in each case, are still speculative, but at least it is
> impossible to analyse the distribution of the wage-earning vote
> without serious allowances for this difference by sex.[^post-29-2]

The reversal is even more significant when age is taken into
consideration. With older voters more likely to vote for the
Conservatives, and older women doing so more than older men, the
differences between younger men and women’s voting behaviour is even
more stark. In this election, there was a huge 18-point swing to [Labour
among younger
women](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/20/youthquake-behind-labour-election-surge-divides-generations)
compared with a 3.5-point swing to Labour among younger men.

The ‘Loss of Working Class’ Support and the Relation to Gender
--------------------------------------------------------------

Another trend in voting behaviour that has been identified by polling is
that, while gaining women’s votes under Blair and Corbyn, Labour is
losing ‘working class’ support. Pollster [James
Morris](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/25/wings-labour-blame-electoral-collapse)
reported, “between 1997 and 2010, for every voter Labour lost from the
professional classes it lost three unskilled or unemployed workers.” The
explanation offered by Morris, and one that has emerged on a particular
section of the anti-Corbyn Labour right, now accepts the argument made
first by Ed Miliband, then with more clarity by Corbyn, that Labour lost
significant working class voters under Blair due to taking them for
granted, as it triangulated support among middle class swing voters.
After losing the Copeland by-election, critiques of Corbyn also saw this
trend continuing, blaming the loss of the seat on a catastrophic lack of
working class support, with the *[Financial
Times](https://www.ft.com/content/5024640c-f37b-11e6-8758-6876151821a6?mhq5j=e1)*
reporting that “Corbyn’s perceived hostility to the nuclear industry,
the biggest employer locally, his pacifism and pro-immigration stance
has alienated voters Labour could once take for granted”, a terrain seen
as being taken over by the ‘Red Tory’ narrative aiming to attract those
[“just about
managing”](http://metro.co.uk/2016/07/13/theresa-may-speech-in-full-as-she-becomes-prime-minister-6005219/).
Although May’s strategy did not succeed as she wished, as is evidenced
by her being pushed to fire her Red Tory advisor after the election,
this narrative has continued, with *[The
Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/20/youthquake-behind-labour-election-surge-divides-generations)*
reporting that “the working classes swung behind Theresa May’s
Conservatives”.

However, this narrative ignores Williams’ realisation, that “it is
impossible to analyse the distribution of the wage-earning vote without
serious allowances for this difference by sex.” In other words, the fact
that (young) working class women vote differently to working class men,
yet, now, in the opposite direction to what Williams was observing in
the 50s and 60s – that is, they are voting for Labour to a greater
extent than men. The fact that this does not fit with the ‘loss of
working class support’ narrative poses some serious questions for how
class is operationalised in polling data. This is done through the use
of the National Readership Survey ‘ABC1’ categorisations, developed over
50 years ago for marketing purposes, which assume class can be gauged
through the proxy of occupational status, regardless of how these
occupations relate to today’s wider capitalist economic structure as a
whole.

In other words, while subordinate economic location and lower grade
manual occupations may, and often do, overlap, those in C2DE jobs do not
exhaust the types of lower-income households in today’s economy. As
[Kyle
Gerhaghty](http://salvage.zone/in-print/class-and-brexit-or-why-we-should-stop-worrying-about-the-working-class-and-focus-on-capitalism/)
explains, “the roots of this lies in the understanding of class as a
hangover from post-war identities, in which there was a stark divide
between professional middle class and working class occupations, and the
consequences of this for average income.” Furthermore, the
identification of job with economic location seems often not to be based
on research evidence but, particularly among political commentators,
more on cultural/ideological assumptions about the type of social and
political consciousness produced by the hand/brain division of labour –
which is thought to give rise to a class based on those with, what
Hobsbawm describes as, a “common proletarian style”: “the rise of
football as a mass proletarian sport, of Blackpool as we still know it
today, of the fish-and-chip shop—all products of the 1880s and 1890s, or
at the earliest the 1870s; the famous cap immortalised by the Andy Capp”
(it is worth noting the male-centredness, and also the non-domesticity -
the fish-and-chip shop, of these) ([p.
232](http://banmarchive.org.uk/collections/mt/pdf/78_09_hobsbawm.pdf)).

The assumption is then often made that these are the sort of people
(men) who should vote Labour, so when they don’t, it is seen as
unnatural. This gives rise to the narrative that Labour has a problem
with the working class, and that Labour also has a long term existential
problem, as these occupational communities disappear. Commenting on the
social grading data that shows the UK is becoming more ‘middle class’ as
C2DE occupations decrease, [Neil
Farrer](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2016/feb/26/uk-more-middle-class-than-working-class-2000-data),
the head of media measurement for Ipsos Connect, said:

> These long term trends collected through high quality research provide
> a real insight into how the make-up of the country has developed over
> the past fifty years. Since we started collecting social grade,
> manufacturing in Great Britain has decreased significantly whilst
> there has been real growth in service related jobs ultimately leading
> to a burgeoning middle class.

However, even in 1961 this argument was a target for criticism from
Williams, who commented that “the point has been reached where the
growing feeling that class is out of date...is being used to ratify a
social system which in other terms than those now visibly breaking down
is still essentially based on economic classes”[^post-29-3].

Whatever the cultural caricatures, those in manual labour remain a
declining part of a wider emerging low wealth/low income section of the
population that does not map neatly onto occupational status. Research
by [Geraghty in *New
Socialist*](https://newsocialist.org.uk/corbyns-emerging-class-coalition/),
has shown that, while occupational status (and education – which can be
mapped quite closely to ABC1 status due to its relationship to skill and
therefore occupation) is declining as a predictor of voting behaviour
(although much less so when dissected by age – with [C2DE voters under
55 still preferring
Labour](https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/how-britain-voted-2017-election?language_content_entity=en-uk)),
income remains a strong predictor of voting behaviour, with low income
voters preferring Labour. This is increasingly supported by tenure, with
renters overwhelmingly moving towards Labour. As Geraghty’s analysis
concludes, using these proxies “provides partial evidence that as
culturally working-class voters are becoming less important to Labour,
it is not necessarily losing the support of the actual working class
defined by economic location.”

While the relation between economic location and political consciousness
has never been straightforward, the fact that there is low income/low
wealth support for Labour, which does not overlap completely with manual
occupations, suggests that the ‘burgeoning middle classes’ of service
sector workers, predominantly women, identified by Ipsos Connect, are a
significant but unacknowledged part of working class support for Labour.

It is also worth noting that, serious problems with these measures
notwithstanding, the way in which such measures are weighted in polling
data also adds further gender bias. Polling companies make use of Census
data and Labour Market Surveys to weight participants in terms of the
ABC1 system. While a social grade is applied to all those in a household
who stated that they were working in the week before the Census, those
who were not working in this week are allocated the grade of the
[‘Household Reference
Person’](http://www.ukgeographics.co.uk/blog/social-grade-a-b-c1-c2-d-e)
(previously ‘Head of the Household’). As women are more likely than men
to be in the [latter
category](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwjZ2v6D7d7UAhWE6xQKHXy2BZcQFggkMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fresearchbriefings.files.parliament.uk%2Fdocuments%2FSN06838%2FSN06838.pdf&usg=AFQjCNG9dXj4Gw2H5_-VXZSetMJJKAs0_w&cad=rja),
polling data is more likely to categorise women by their partner’s
occupation and may consequently classify women to a higher social grade
than they actually have.

The fact that the ABC1 system operationalises the occupational
categories and assumptions of, essentially, a male breadwinner model,
through categories based upon male occupational communities and often by
aggregating household data, shows that it is inadequate to take into
account how social class functions today, and particularly the role of
gender within it. This is not to under-emphasise the link between
occupational status and social class and, in particular, [low skilled
workers’ tendency to be
poorer](http://salvage.zone/in-print/class-and-brexit-or-why-we-should-stop-worrying-about-the-working-class-and-focus-on-capitalism/).
However, it does not capture the complexity of the contemporary
capitalist economy and, in particular, women’s place within it, both as
workers and within households.

The Recomposition and Feminisation of the Working Class
-------------------------------------------------------

The recomposition of the working class is a generic feature of
capitalism and is, as Hall argues, accelerated in “periods of economic
crisis or recession” ([p.
16](http://banmarchive.org.uk/collections/mt/pdf/82_11_16.pdf)). The
current organisation of the working class is largely the result of two
crises and their resolutions, firstly the crisis analysed by Hall of the
1970s, secondly the crisis of 2007-8, which has its roots in those
resolutions. As
[Fraser](https://newleftreview.org/article/download_pdf?id=2772) argues,
a major feature of the neoliberal resolution of the crisis of the 1970s,
what she describes as, the “historical shift in the character of
capitalism, from the state-organized variant... to neoliberalism” was
the bringing of women into the workforce,

> Neoliberal capitalism has as much to do with Walmart, maquiladoras and
> microcredit as with Silicon Valley and Google. And its indispensable
> workers are disproportionately women, not only young single women, but
> also married women and women with children; not only racialized women,
> but women of virtually all nationalities and ethnicities. As such,
> women have poured into labour markets around the globe; the effect has
> been to undercut once and for all state-organized capitalism’s ideal
> of the family wage.

As Fraser implies, these women were often employed in subordinate,
precarious and deeply exploited roles. Against the argument that the
development of a service based economy, at least in the Global North
under neoliberalism, meant the disappearance of the working class, it
should be clear that what actually happened was the feminisation of the
working class. A further aspect of this feminisation of the working
class is the proletarianisation, particularly accelerated in the wake of
2007-8, of sections of previously “middle class” occupations as they
became performed by women.

The occupational categories as an inadequate proxy for class, therefore,
correspond broadly to a distinction between manual and mental work
(where what is described as “affective” work fits in here, is unclear).
This distinction as a class category is behind even Labour’s old [Clause
IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clause_IV), which focuses on both
“workers by hand and workers by brain”. With large parts of women’s
employment concentrated in secretarial and administrative (C1) and lower
professional (B), many women register as middle-class while, in terms of
pay, control over work and security, being deeply disempowered.
Moreover, occupational categories fail to account for whether work is
full-time or part-time, permanent or temporary, so women, again, more
likely to be in temporary and part-time work
[(42%](https://www.google.es/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjVtfbY7t7UAhXGQBQKHQQgAlsQFgg4MAI&url=http%3A%2F%2Fresearchbriefings.files.parliament.uk%2Fdocuments%2FSN06838%2FSN06838.pdf&usg=AFQjCNG9dXj4Gw2H5_-VXZSetMJJKAs0_w))
register in an occupational category “above” the reality of their class.

Referring to the recomposition as a result of the 1970s crisis, and
sceptical about the consequent ‘disappearance of the working class’,
Hall nevertheless realises how this might affect not just the industrial
and economic structure of labour, but its politics and culture: “such
social mobility as occurred was largely the result of service and
non-manual occupations replacing the manual skilled trades identified
with the 'solid' working class. But shifts in the boundaries and
imageries of class are not without their political and ideological
consequences.” ([p.
20](http://banmarchive.org.uk/collections/mt/pdf/82_11_16.pdf)) These
changes did have an impact on the labour movement and the Labour Party
and, in particular, women’s relation to it, as they were largely
excluded from its inception and labourist form.

Labourism
---------

Hall describes how a certain configuration of the organised working
class were formative in establishing the labour movement, and,
consequently, in instituting its political and cultural forms:

> For this skilled and semi-skilled manual working class stratum defined
> the dominant patterns of industrial unionism at a formative stage of
> the labour movement. It is also where the traditions of militancy and
> struggle are nurtured in the popular memory of the movement. It also
> defined the culture of the working class movement. ([p.
> 17](http://banmarchive.org.uk/collections/mt/pdf/82_11_16.pdf))

Hall writes that because of their ‘vanguard’ role in its inception, this
also gave the impression of a direct, uncomplicated and natural link
between the organised working class standing in for the whole of the
class and the Party creating the myth that “pure class position
guarantees voting behaviour or political support” when “in between the
two lies the indeterminate terrain of politics, where these connections
can be won or lost, depending on how struggles are conducted and what
the balance of political forces turns out to be.” ([p.
16-7](http://banmarchive.org.uk/collections/mt/pdf/82_11_16.pdf)) The
indeterminate terrain in which the class consciousness at stake here was
produced were predominantly workplaces that led to a political and
industrial organisation that, although secured meaningful victories for
labour against capital, was economistic, patriarchal and hierarchical –
precisely because it was subordinate to capitalist society.

Wainwright and Massey describe the mining communities that were
emblematic of this type of politics as

> Predominantly white; they are socially conservative; traditional
> sexual divisions of labour – woman as home-maker, man as bread-winner
> – have been deeply ingrained...Their politics have been
> workplace-based. They are the fiefdoms of one of the most important
> unions in labour movement history, symbolizing – at least for men –
> the old strengths of a solidarity born of mutual dependence at work,
> and the reliance of a whole community on a single industry...They are
> heartlands of labourism.[^post-29-4]

It is precisely this traditional labourist politics that may be the
reason why many working class women did not support Labour at this time.
The ‘social conservatism’ of these communities perhaps underlies the
fact that, as both Williams and, here, Hall acknowledge, “the working
class vote has always, historically, contained a significant proportion
of Tory voters, ever since the Conservatives resolved that they would
have to forge the working class connection if the party were to survive
the coming of mass democracy” ([p.
17](http://banmarchive.org.uk/collections/mt/pdf/82_11_16.pdf)).
However, without the counter-hegemony of workplace solidarity that
working men experienced, Williams observes that, “in addition to
wage-earning Conservative families, there were many Conservative wives
of Labour husbands”[^post-29-5].

It is not only that women were not subject to the politicisation of work
place struggles; they did have a role that included them in the social
whole of the wider world of labour through their, often strictly
policed, separation. Hall states that “some of the older occupational
communities maintain a particular sexual division of labour, a tight set
of familiar roles and loyalties” ([p.
19](http://banmarchive.org.uk/collections/mt/pdf/82_11_16.pdf)). As
Vogel argues, the sexual division of labour under capitalism is unique
in “forc\[ing\] a severe spatial, temporal, and institutional separation
between domestic labour and the capitalist
production-process”[^post-29-6]. This has the advantage (for the
capitalist) of splitting (and further obscuring) the necessary labour
workers have to do to acquire and enjoy the means of subsistence, and so
reproduce themselves (and others); forcing the worker to work for a
wage, which they then need to ‘realise’ through a certain amount of
supplementary labour (buying and cooking a meal for example). By
requiring the worker, or, historically, a female member of their family,
to do this in a separate space, capital devalues and naturalises it, so
that it remains uncompensated. Vogel explains this further by a contrast
with “class-societies based on agriculture – feudalism, for example –
the labour-processes of necessary labour are frequently integrated with
those of surplus-production.”[^post-29-7]

The separation of domestic labour from wage labour means labourist
struggles are strictly separated from and do nothing to improve the
conditions of women in the spaces of reproductive labour (the domestic
side of necessary labour) or, indeed, produce, for women, the political
and social consciousness to inculcate the solidarity to struggle for
them. Instead, the domestic is also separated culturally and, as such,
women were subject to an attenuated code to men’s solidarity; indeed a
code which proscribes a set of behaviours that create the conditions of
possibility for that solidarity, while simultaneously, providing
justification for it – and one that had more consanguinity with
Conservative values than Labour ones, as Hall acknowledges, “working
class unity and labour movement fraternity have often been underpinned
by certain versions of masculinity, traditionalism and domestic
respectability.” ([p.
19](http://banmarchive.org.uk/collections/mt/pdf/82_11_16.pdf))

Labourism in the Context of the Recomposition of the Working Class
------------------------------------------------------------------

As the working class was being recomposed in the final third of the
twentieth century, the material basis for these ‘labourist’ political
forms was being dismantled, with “one aspect” of this being “the general
decline of those sectors of the economy where skilled workers of this
type predominated, and with the decline of those geographical regions
which constituted the industrial heartland of the early labour
movement.” ([p.
18](http://banmarchive.org.uk/collections/mt/pdf/82_11_16.pdf)) Of
course, over time, “changes in the structure and composition of the
working class are likely to affect the industrial structure and
political culture of the labour movement” ([p.
17](http://banmarchive.org.uk/collections/mt/pdf/82_11_16.pdf)).
However, this process is not straightforward or immediate, with Hall’s
shift from the past when talking about the decline in economic sectors
to the speculative (“likely to affect”) suggesting there may be a
significant lag between economic processes and the ways in which they
are lived. Again we are dealing with the ‘indeterminate terrain of
politics’.

Hall remarks on the failure of parts of the labour movement to adapt –
and Wainwright and Massey were, in fact, writing about the mining
communities in the time of their decline, as being seen as “‘old
fashioned’, sectional and, by implication, bankrupt. Male manual
workers, the old working class with a vengeance, fighting to save jobs
in what is officially described as a declining industry, state-owned and
located in isolated declining regions” [^post-29-8]. For Hall:

> It should be evident what risks we run if the movement continues to
> have real roots only in the declining sections of a class. It must
> reflect - in organisation and culture - the real diversity and
> complexity of class formation. Its historic commitments cannot prevent
> it from centrally engaging occupational patterns and cultures thrown
> up by the new capitalist division of labour...A labour movement which
> is not sufficiently open to allow the currents of modern life, which
> are influencing and shaping its members, to blow through its
> structures and procedures is living off its past at the expense of the
> future ([p.
> 19](http://banmarchive.org.uk/collections/mt/pdf/82_11_16.pdf)).

In a situation where the waning industrial strength of labour to deliver
even partial victories that supported working class household incomes,
whether through industrial action or the state, had been worn down,
labourism offered even less to working class women, with its
institutions and cultures rooted in the exclusion or subordination of
women and becoming increasingly irrelevant to everyday life. This
breakdown of capacities run through the 1970s, and the miners’ strike
can be read as the last major struggle of this sequence, but also,
importantly, a struggle that opened up possibilities of new forms of
post-labourist class politics.

As both Williams, regarding the 1959 election, and Hall on 1979, remark,
it has also been a concerted political effort of the Conservatives (as
in the 2017 election) to gain working class votes, which they perhaps
did by speaking to the new experiences and social and cultural
readjustments that emerged as a result of the recomposition of the class
better than Labour. Of this new habitus, Williams writes how

> I am not greatly surprised that contemporary Conservatism...makes
> sense as an interpretation of it to very many people. For at just this
> point, Labour seems to have very little to offer. A different version
> of community, a pattern of new consciousness, it has not been able to
> give. Its compromise policies combine the two irrelevant elements of
> appeal to old and fading habits and memories, and of cultural
> adjustment to the present social confusion.[^post-29-9]

The Socialist Feminist Influence on Labour
------------------------------------------

However, in the crisis caused by this recomposition of class, and the
failure of labourism to provide an adequate industrial structure and
political culture to deal with it, opportunities arose to realign the
labour movement to the needs and desires of a broader, more contemporary
and diverse alliance of workers and non-workers; and here many women and
others, including PoC, were crucial. As Hall writes at the time of this
realignment:

> What is at issue here is ultimately the politics of constructing the
> unity of a class - and in a recognisably present and modern, not
> simply historical, form. Heroic attachments to the past will serve for
> tall stories in the working men's club, but may not have much living
> connection to the real problems of class, party and movement today
> ([p. 19](http://banmarchive.org.uk/collections/mt/pdf/82_11_16.pdf))

Instead, he argues, the labour movement “must discover ways of
reflecting, in its social values, both the tight solidarities of the old
communities and the greater diversity and openness of the new.” ([p.
19](http://banmarchive.org.uk/collections/mt/pdf/82_11_16.pdf)) It was
such an alliance between the old communities and the urban New Left and
women’s movement that Wainwright and Massey were writing about when
discussing the coalition of activists coming together around the miner’s
strike in just such traditional communities as outlined above. In many
ways, the new movement was ahead of the party structure and the
industrial leadership,

> With trade union leadership at sixes and sevens, their creaking
> structures, and their lack of credibility, unable to lead any
> response, and with the party political leadership embarrassed by the
> whole affair – in spite of, maybe because of, all the heavy-footed
> inertia – there has sprung up a completely different way of organizing
> support, indeed an expansion of what the concept of support means.
> ‘The grass roots’, people of all sorts, previously politically active
> and not, have just got on with it.[^post-29-10]

Wainwright discusses further, in *Labour: A Tale of Two Parties*, not
only how women’s sections in the Labour Party were central to supporting
the miner’s strike (often when the CLPs themselves were not), but how
the influence of their activity and the politicisation that went with
the experience of communal struggles over supporting livelihoods and
communities, led to other women joining the Party. A long-running
industrial strike, for all the arguments of those who presented the
miners’ struggle as old-fashioned and purely labourist, is also a point
at which the barriers that had previously separated labourist and
reproductive struggles are broken. It reveals how domestic labour
supports, and is a condition of possibility for, labour solidarity, as
women, and the community as a whole, are required to use their
resourcefulness to extend provisioning, at the point where men withdraw
from earning the means of subsistence. This extension is achieved
through socialising these tasks within the community, but with the
subsequent result of politicising whole sections of it in ways beyond
previously contained labourist and economistic struggles.

This politicisation can outrun the structures that gave rise to it, and
as such, challenge their orthodoxy; as Wainwright observes how “the
response of women’s sections and, by contrast, of some of their CLPs, to
the 1984 miners’ strike also illustrates divergence of the two views of
democracy”[^post-29-11]. Women’s sections were largely reanimated by
socialist feminists, as well as younger women, (re-)joining the Labour
Party in the early 80s, and, with their experience of organising around
women’s liberation and wider social movements, they turned their
attention to democratising its structures and opening up its culture. As
Wainwright observed,

> When you look at the values and ideas of feminism’s participatory
> democracy it is obvious that there will be tensions, to say the least,
> between the women’s sections influenced by feminism and the more
> traditional forms of representative democracy in the Labour
> movement...the liberation of women is not a matter of political
> equality alone. Unless women also have economic independence, and
> control over their own bodies and sexuality, unless child care and
> other domestic work is reorganised, then women will still, whatever
> their formal rights, be subordinate. This approach frequently leads
> the new women’s sections to work with groups of women involved in
> social, community and economic issues which the rest of the party,
> left and right, does not consider ‘political’.[^post-29-12]

Through this approach, although met with resistance, women were able to
expand the sites of political struggle beyond work-places and
production. Labourism saw the “factory, office or enterprise” as “a
black box with the value of labour power going in one end, and surplus
value coming out of the other”, and viewed politics as a “confrontation
between sectional interests” [^post-29-13] over the spoils. Both the
kinds of processes of social reproduction required to produce ‘the value
of labour power’ as well as what went on inside the ‘black box’, which
was a site of struggle taken up by 1980s New Unionism and other parts of
the Labour left, were politicised, addressing the concerns of women,
both as the new workers of capitalism and within households as primary
carers, and, often, now performing the ‘double shift’.

New Unionism in the 1980s
-------------------------

Women had some successes in changing party structures and culture,
however, some of the strongest opposition came from some unions, which
Wainwright describes as “the ‘dead souls’ of Labourism” because of how
they automatically incorporated trade union members into the Party,
meaning that “the organised working class is represented – indeed, in a
dominant position – within the party, formally through their unions”
[^post-29-14]. However, female expansion of the labour force meant that
unions were increasingly dependent on attracting women members, whose
demands they needed to incorporate. As Hall explains:

> The newer industrial strata are certain to...reflect the rising
> proportion of women in the workforce, and thus the growing place of
> part-time work and 'feminised' work roles. The labour movement must
> therefore prepare itself for a massive adaptation to new needs and
> demands - for example, the demand for greater flexibility in work
> organisation. The unions in general will have increasingly to take up
> new topics for negotiation and press for new requirements in
> conditions of employment. It also follows, I suspect, that the
> patriarchalism of leadership, hierarchy and authority which so
> strongly marks earlier styles of political and industrial organisation
> will not survive the impact ([p.
> 19](http://banmarchive.org.uk/collections/mt/pdf/82_11_16.pdf)).

This new industrial structure is perhaps seen most in clearly in the
unions for sectors that had the most women workers and therefore had
increasing amount of women members, such as the public service union,
NUPE. Not only did NUPE make economistic demands on behalf of its
majority female workforce, it engaged in political education and
campaigning in order to build “support for industrial action on
political issues such as privatisation and the job losses and
deterioration of conditions that goes with it”[^post-29-15].

In both the CLPs and the unions, these changes, shaped by women’s
involvement, were ensuring that the Labour Party was engaging beyond its
labourist base and changing the party from below. It is also worth
noting here who was involved in this grass roots movement and taking it
into the parliamentary labour party itself, as Wainwright explains,
“this persuasive, outward going kind of politics is particularly clear
in the behaviour of the new breed of MP and parliamentary candidate:
\[such as\] Jeremy Corbyn in Islington”[^post-29-16], who was previously
a NUPE organiser as well.

On the one hand, the movement was being rebuilt, and its relation to the
party remade, to better reflect contemporary class composition, and, in
particular, women – often against great resistance – were changing its
sexist culture and practices so that it did not actively exclude women
in the way that old labourist politics did, although even today, this
endeavour is not complete. However, on the other hand, another major
reason for women joining the party at this time, and perhaps voting
Labour – for the first time on a par with men, was because of “Thatcher
and attacks from the right” (Wainwright) which were undermining the
social fabric with disproportionate effects on women’s lives in
particular.

Thatcher to Blair – Wrecking and Resourcing the Social Fabric
-------------------------------------------------------------

Although a condition of capitalism’s possibility, as discussed above,
social reproduction processes are obscured by the spatial, temporal,
institutional and cultural separation between domestic labour and the
capitalist production-process[^post-29-17]. This means that even as
women are increasingly entering employment, their public role is
generally split from, and leaves substantially unchanged their ‘private
role’, as Federici explains, “getting a second job does not change that
role, as years and years of female work outside the home have
demonstrated. The second job not only increases our exploitation, but
simply reproduces our role in different forms.”[^post-29-18] This
reliance on women’s unpaid labour, while as far as possible requiring
women to be direct producers too, means their capacity to maintain
households is always under strain, and the domestic sphere is
generically under-resourced and in crisis.
[Fraser](https://newleftreview.org/II/100/nancy-fraser-contradictions-of-capital-and-care)
explains:

> In general, then, capitalist societies separate social reproduction
> from economic production, associating the first with women, and
> obscuring its importance and value. Paradoxically, however, they make
> their official economies dependent on the very same processes of
> social reproduction whose value they disavow. This peculiar relation
> of separation-cum-dependence-cum-disavowal is an inherent source of
> instability: on the one hand, capitalist economic production is not
> self- sustaining, but relies on social reproduction; on the other, its
> drive to unlimited accumulation threatens to destabilize the very
> reproductive processes and capacities that capital — and the rest of
> us — need

In this way, maintenance of the ‘social fabric’ through the state’s
taking on of some aspects of social reproduction in public services such
as schools, hospitals, care homes, childcare, as well as resourcing
reproduction through welfare and direct transfers, can be seen to be
disproportionately important to women. As the [Women’s Budget
Group](http://cpag.org.uk/sites/default/files/CPAG-Poverty154-10-years-austerity-summer2016.pdf)
argue, “women rely more heavily on public services and social security
transfers, as gender norms operate to maintain women on low incomes and
in a primary carer role.”

Although always in crisis, these contradictions are generally
stabilised, if never permanently resolved. However, the economic crisis
of the beginning in the late 60s that led to the recomposition of the
class within capitalist production, also initiated a readjustment in the
settlement between the sphere of production and that of social
reproduction, what
[Fraser](https://newleftreview.org/II/86/nancy-fraser-behind-marx-s-hidden-abode)
has called ‘boundary struggles’. The post-war settlement of these
boundaries, which itself was a compromise in response to the depression,
mass unemployment, pauperisation and radicalisation, was drawn
comparatively on the side of social reproduction. State provision of
social welfare coupled with an acceptance of unionisation and higher
wages – in some cases (to a sub-group of privileged male workers, such
as in the occupational communities outlined above), a family wage,
re-resourced social reproduction, while giving workers a stake in the
system, as [Fraser
argues](https://newleftreview.org/II/100/nancy-fraser-contradictions-of-capital-and-care),

> Public investment in health care, schooling, childcare and old-age
> pensions, supplemented by corporate provision, was perceived as a
> necessity in an era in which capitalist relations had penetrated
> social life to such an extent that the working classes no longer
> possessed the means to reproduce themselves on their own.

This state-managed capitalism was dismantled in the context of the
economic crisis of the 70s, which put significant pressure on social
reproduction. The neoliberal regime, embodied by the project of
Thatcherism, was itself a state project, but one aimed at accelerating
the ‘liberalising’ effects of the crisis in order to resolve it in the
ruling class’s favour. “[Globalizing and
neoliberal](https://newleftreview.org/II/100/nancy-fraser-contradictions-of-capital-and-care),
this regime promotes state and corporate disinvestment from social
welfare, while recruiting women into the paid workforce —externalizing
carework onto families and communities while diminishing their capacity
to perform it.” Undoubtedly, the consequent break down of stabilised
family and community organisation that resulted from this was
experienced by a number of men and women in a revanchist way:

> There is a failure to recognise the role of economic restructuring in
> disabling the domestic sector and undermining its ability to make
> provision for both its needs and the needs of the other sectors.
> Instead, there is a tendency to postulate this disability as stemming
> from the break-up of patriarchal family structures. ([p.
> 16](http://www.ciedur.org.uy/adm/archivos/publicacion_197.pdf))

For some – particularly for some women – Thatcher initially appeared to
offer a solution to the social fallout of the economic crisis as she was
able to articulate the consequent strain put on the domestic sphere in a
right populist way through themes of social breakdown. As Hall argues,
Thatcherism like all successful right populisms, “addresses real
problems, real and lived experiences, real contradictions—and yet is
able to represent them within a logic of discourse which pulls them
systematically into line with policies and class strategies of the
Right.” ([p.
20](http://banmarchive.org.uk/collections/mt/pdf/79_01_hall.pdf)) This
is not least because of the way in which organised labour, on the
defensive against the onslaught of free-market liberalisation, was not
able to generalise the struggle, with the “Winter of Discontent”
affecting family life without labour militancy achieving gains beyond
male sectional interests. Thatcher was able to make a case for the
restoration of stability through an appeal to national interests
presented as in opposition to the partial, sectional interests of Trade
Unionism that was essentially ideological, and by ignoring the
underlying economic restructuring, quickly led to an oppositional
response.

Women were in a privileged position to see through this right wing
articulation for precisely the same reasons that this articulation
appealed to them in 1979 – being those most affected by the
disintegration of the social fabric, and had greater reason to be
disillusioned with Thatcher. With “wages fall\[ing\] below the socially
necessary costs of reproduction”, forcing the norm of the two-earner
household, women’s ‘double shift’, while state investment in
reproduction was being withdrawn, increased the drudgery and
improvisation needed to knit together a reasonable work and family life.
Federici writes in 1980, “women today work harder than in the past. This
is particularly true for women heads of families and women with low
wages, who are often forced to moonlight to make ends
meet”[^post-29-19]. They also had experience of those areas of public
life most affected by neoliberal reforms, witnessing how the withdrawal
of the state from social provisioning affected schools and hospitals.

As workers in the public sector, which mostly employed women, women were
organising as part of New Unionism. Wainwright observes how “NUPE led
strikes and other kinds of direct action against low pay, in defence of
the NHS and against cuts in public spending”[^post-29-20]. Some women
were also politicised as a result of their involvement in support groups
for the miner’s strike, as outlined above. Although this action was
largely defensive, the forms of organisation it required challenged the
status quo, as the involvement of women necessarily challenged some of
the conservative aspects of the communities they were defending. The
visibility of the feminist movement, as well as women’s increasing
economic and social power from their entrance into the labour force, led
many to reject the social conservatism and domestic ideals of feminity
that naturalised their role, and the right wing resolution that blamed
social disintegration on the breakup of the patriarchal family.

The Labour Party, evolving in less sexist and macho ways, was able to
articulate some of this discontent, as this [Party Political Broadcast
from 1981 makes clear](https://www.youtube.com/embed/3_LrvmbxrX4).
Although this broadcast registers how women became active in Labour on
the back of these experiences, it is symptomatic of how a far greater
number of women, while they did not get involved in Labour or left
politics in this period, stopped voting for the Conservatives and voted
Labour, meaning women’s Labour vote was steadily increasing from the low
base of 1983. This also dovetails with the declining political power of
those sections of working class men for whom the failure of labourist
politics to defend the social democratic settlement may have led to
disillusionment with the Labour Party (and men’s votes for Labour tanked
by 10 points from 1979 to 1983).

At the promise of New Labour, both men’s and women’s Labour vote jumped
in 1997, and, in the context of two decades of under-resourcing the
social fabric, the prospect of “[better schools, better hospitals,
better ways of tackling crime, of building a modern welfare state, of
equipping ourselves for a new world
economy](http://www.politicsresources.net/area/uk/man/lab97.htm)” proved
electorally appealing.

New Labour’s Modernisation Agenda
---------------------------------

As well as investing in public services and easing the pressures on
families and women in particular, like Jeremy Corbyn today, Tony Blair
rejected a ‘labourist’ notion of the Party. Recognising the dangers of
what Wainwright identifies as labourism’s assumption that “the Labour
Party speaks for the whole of the working class”[^post-29-21], New
Labour understood that it must work to build coalitions beyond the
traditional base to secure an electoral majority. However, New Labour’s
critique of labourism, and coalition building on the basis of a
recomposed class, did not go far enough. Blair did not so much take up
Hall’s challenge of engaging in “the politics of constructing the unity
of a class - and in a recognisably present and modern, not simply
historical, form”, than discard class politics in favour of constructing
politics in the image of the modern that “differs from the old left and
the Conservative right.” The [1997
Manifesto](http://www.politicsresources.net/area/uk/man/lab97.htm)
continues, “this is why new Labour is new. New Labour is a party of
ideas and ideals but not of outdated ideology. What counts is what
works. The objectives are radical. The means will be modern.”

New Labour’s belief in a post-class society, was, paradoxically
underpinned by a non-questioning of the link between class and party as
forged by labourism, but believed labourism to be old-fashioned waning
class politics that they could move beyond (while also taking for
granted). While Blair understood the declining size and political power
of this particular section of the class, he did not share in Williams’
insight that “the point has been reached where the growing feeling that
class is out of date...is being used to ratify a social system which in
other terms than those now visibly breaking down is still essentially
based on economic classes” [^post-29-22]. Moreover, the lack of faith in
building the labour movement meant that the work of political persuasion
was not so much based in political education and grass roots organising,
but in media and parliamentary politics; and people’s needs where not so
much meet by arousing their popular demands and capacities, but in
top-down technocratic solutions – “what works”.

Despite accepting the shift in power from labour to capital, this
modernising agenda did deliver real effects: investing in public
services, and, while accepting the two-earner household as norm, tax
credits and the minimum wage, which disproportionately benefited women
in lower paid sectors, helped to resource social reproduction. In fact,
in implementing the minimum wage, New Labour were acting on demands from
women-centred unions such as NUPE against those representing male
sectional interests. Wainwright observes how Eric Hammond, the General
Secretary of the EETPU, “treated the debate about the statutory minimum
wage as a kind of virility test, implying that the advocates of the
statutory minimum wage were just covering up their own impotence”.
While, rightly here, siding with “one of the several unions organising
the growing underclass of the low-paid” rather than one of “workers
whose wages have increased under Thatcherism”[^post-29-23], the Labour
Government were – by, at the same time, accepting the underlying
economic logic of neoliberalism – creating the conditions through
legislation restricting collective bargaining that ensured Hammond’s
boasting could only be a show of masculine bravado. By effectively
evacuating the sphere of industrial struggle, New Labour defined their
role as ameliorative state intervention around the edges of capitalism,
as well as adapting the unions to the consumerist values of the market.

Enclosing New Left Critique
---------------------------

Accepting the NUPE line on the minimum wage, against the more
traditional trade unions, was one of the ways New Labour was
‘enclosing’, for its own purposes, the insights of the New Left critique
of labourism from the 80s, and in so doing reconciling parts of the left
into its basic capitulation to Thatcher’s neoliberal reforms. This is
part of a wider thesis that understands capitalism, and its agents, as
colonising and neutralising its anti-capitalist opposition. [Fraser
summarises](https://newleftreview.org/II/56/nancy-fraser-feminism-capitalism-and-the-cunning-of-history)
the argument that Luc Boltanski and Ève Chiapello make in The New Spirit
of Capitalism, that

> Capitalism periodically remakes itself in moments of historical
> rupture, in part by recuperating strands of critique directed against
> it. In such moments, elements of anti-capitalist critique are
> resignified to legitimate an emergent new form of capitalism, which
> thereby becomes endowed with the higher, moral significance needed to
> motivate new generations to shoulder the inherently meaningless work
> of endless accumulation.

The emergence of New Left critiques of state paternalism coincided with
attempts to settle the capitalist crisis in a neoliberal way. By taking
over the socially liberalising thrust of social movements, struggles for
personal political freedom became used not just as a justification to
reform the state in its social functions but in its economic ones too.

> [Out of the
> collision](https://newleftreview.org/II/100/nancy-fraser-contradictions-of-capital-and-care)
> of these two sets of struggles there emerged a surprising result: a
> ‘progressive’ neoliberalism, which celebrates ‘diversity’, meritocracy
> and ‘emancipation’ while dismantling social protections and
> re-externalizing social reproduction. The result is not only to
> abandon defenceless populations to capital’s predations, but also to
> redefine emancipation in market terms.

Largely in the UK these tendencies appeared in the ways in which New
Labour incorporated sections of the left into neoliberalism but earlier
tendencies where this critique pulled rightwards and in a notably
anti-working class way are apparent, notably in Beatrix Campbell’s (who
is, presumably, one of the targets of Wainwright and Massey’s critique
of those who treated the strike as macho and old-fashioned) opposition
to the miners’ strike.

Fraser argues that feminist strands of critique have been particularly
susceptible to this redeployment because of their mistrust of
traditional androcentric authority, so that “[aspirations
that](https://newleftreview.org/II/56/nancy-fraser-feminism-capitalism-and-the-cunning-of-history)
had a clear emancipatory thrust in the context of state-organized
capitalism assumed a far more ambiguous meaning in the neoliberal era.”
Well-founded and perceptive criticism of what Hall has described as “the
patriarchalism of leadership, hierarchy and authority which so strongly
marks earlier styles of political and industrial organisation” ([p.
19](http://banmarchive.org.uk/collections/mt/pdf/82_11_16.pdf)) became
redeployed to legitimate acceptance of the depleted power of labour and
the inability of government to intervene in the economy. For example,
under New Labour, feminist criticisms of the welfare state as
undemocratic, impersonal and alienating were metamorphosed into the
personalisation, independent living and choice agendas. Encapsulating
the "progressive neoliberalism" that Fraser expounds above, in the
[British Journal of Learning
Disabilities](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bld.12069/full),
the personalisation agenda is described as being “underpinned by a range
of ideologies, particularly a civil rights empowerment approach and
neoliberal market discourses.” Under the justification that services
needed to be tailored to the individual rather than delivered in a
one-size-fits-all fashion, New Labour invited a diverse market of
providers, including private sector providers beheld to the profit
motif, to deliver state services. As [Christopher
Blewitt](https://newsocialist.org.uk/independence-is-not-the-same-as-isolation/)
for *New Socialist* has argued, this has led to a policy direction that
operates under the counterintuitive understanding that independence is
promoted best through the removal of benefits to prevent state
dependency.

Conversely, while using socially liberalising discourse as the face of
free market reforms of the welfare state, leaving the basic economic
structure and all the harm it did intact meant using authoritarian
solutions for ‘social’ problems. Such revanchist interventions had more
in common with Thatcherite right wing articulations of the breakdown of
the social fabric and patriarchal family albeit in the modernised jargon
of ‘hard to reach’ families. [Elson, in her 1998
article](http://www.ciedur.org.uy/adm/archivos/publicacion_197.pdf),
recognises the incompleteness of the diagnosis made by the Secretary of
State for Education and Employment at that time, David Blunkett, that
blames parents for why the UK lacks a skilled workforce. She quotes him
as saying, “where there is a problem it is all too often because parents
claim not to have the time, because they have disengaged from their
children's education or because, quite simply, they lack even the basics
of parenting skill.” For Elson, this explanation has

> No recognition of the likely impact on parenting of the extremely long
> hours of paid work undertaken by many of those men and women in
> Britain who do have paid jobs; nor of the impact of insecurity,
> unemployment and loss of hope and self-respect as whole communities
> are crushed by the force of the global market. ([p.
> 15-6](http://www.ciedur.org.uy/adm/archivos/publicacion_197.pdf))

Clearly there are criticisms to be made of New Labour’s politics,
particularly for poor women, single mothers and those on welfare, and in
many cases there was rapid disillusion for both men and women, whose
combined Labour vote subsequently began diminishing in the New Labour
elections after ’97. However, Blair was able to project a modernity that
did seem to reflect the currents of people’s lives, with a socially
liberal agenda that included civil partnerships and a focus on equal
opportunities, which did not exclude women in the way ‘old left’
politics did. Also the ambiguous modernisation of failing public
services did offer relief from decades of underinvestment that may have
particularly affected women and, with men’s vote share falling at a
faster pace, women overtook men in voting Labour in 2005, since when
women have been more likely than men to vote Labour, especially in
recent election with Jeremy Corbyn as leader.

Rebuilding the Labour Movement for Social Reproduction
------------------------------------------------------

It is notable that, although it is an increasing trend for women to vote
for Labour more than men, they did so in particularly higher numbers in
the recent election. It is also worth remembering that, although
‘enclosed’ by the most recent incarnation of Labour government, Corbyn
hails from the New Left movement whose insights were an attempt to
expand the old fashioned and sexist labourist notion of class in order
to truly engage in “the politics of constructing the unity of a class -
and in a recognisably present and modern, not simply historical, form”.
While Blair took the labourist husk of this class for granted, and
Corbyn is blamed for losing their support, we can, in fact, see in the
Corbyn project a renewal of New Left attempts to build a movement based
on a notion of class that is objectively rooted and, importantly,
includes women, as well as PoC.

In this expanded notion based on economic location, those who were the
male skilled manual workers largely in occupational communities have to
be addressed as what they are now and understood as part of a wider
coalition based on how class was recomposed in the 70s, and again, after
the crisis in 2007-8. Sometimes referred to as the ‘left behind
communities’, there is, in fact, evidence that they did indeed swing
behind Corbyn in this election.\[H\] This is not surprising given that
the loss of manufacturing after industrial restructuring from the 70s
was largely replaced by the low paid service sector. The recent economic
crisis has caused further precarity, with the predicted high rate of
unemployment only avoided through greater casualisation, expansion of
self-employment and underemployment. This means that, particularly for
the women, but also increasingly the men in these communities and others
across the UK, issues such as low pay, zero hours contracts, a
meaningful welfare safety net as well as adequate services such as
schools and hospitals were key. In this light, what were the labourist
communities now look increasingly like a modern day working class, of
both men and women, in insecure and low paid work, with a disintegrating
infrastructure and social fabric exacerbated by a decade of imposed
austerity. How the Coalition and Conservative governments have dealt
with the crisis of 2007-8 has, however, had “significant, and
disproportionate, negative impacts...on women and low-income households
(in which women predominate)”, with research by the [House of Commons
Library](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/16/women-austerity-poor-vulnerable-gender-inequality)
finding that 86% of the burden of austerity since 2010 falling on them
and projections by [Landman Economics and the Women’s Budget
Group](http://cpag.org.uk/sites/default/files/CPAG-Poverty154-10-years-austerity-summer2016.pdf)
showing that government plans to 2020 will mean that “women in single
adult households face disproportionate cuts overall, with female lone
parents, female single pensioners and single childless women having
their living standards reduced by 21 per cent, 20 per cent and 17 per
cent respectively."

![austerity](/Users/joe/Projects/nsbooks/what-sort-of-victory/data/austerity.png)

By basing politics on the true working class of today, meaning the
low-income households in which women predominate, rather than a
nostalgic labourist notion of that class, Corbyn’s Labour Party is able
to seek to address these issues from an expanded site of politics. No
longer wedded to merely getting the best deal for this privileged male
section of the class, Labour politics is able to go into the hidden
abode of, not just production, but also reproduction. Wainwright
explains how the New Left, which Corbyn was part of, was already
attempting to “focus on the purposes of production” in the 1980s:

> First, it has involved a concern with the nature of the commodities or
> services themselves and their technology, whether they are weapons,
> pollutants, unsafe deodorants, unhealthy food or unresponsive public
> services. Second, it has stimulated a greater emphasis on the quality
> of working conditions, on health and safety, the ues and design of
> technology and the control of labour’s time – time for education, for
> childcare, for recreation. Related to these concerns is a scrutiny of
> the division of labour, its sexual and racial roots as well as its
> basis in class power. And third, the influence of the new socialism
> has stressed the relationship between the workplace and its
> surrounding community.[^post-29-24]

This has been adapted for today by some of the ideas in *[Labour’s
Alternative Models of
Ownership](http://www.labour.org.uk/page/-/PDFs/9472_Alternative%20Models%20of%20Ownership%20all_v4.pdf)*,
which *[New
Socialist](https://newsocialist.org.uk/labours-alternative-models-of-ownership-report/)*
argued have some of their roots in the socialist feminism of the New
Left. Its electoral appeal to women is not merely in a promise to
provide relief from a disintegrating social fabric, where the best that
can be hoped for is a government that helps resource social reproduction
for the sake of labour, with schools and hospitals provided for the sake
of a skilled and healthy workforce, but where, with production purposed
for people rather than the other way round, people can genuinely enjoy a
fulfilling and expansive life with their family and community.

Nevertheless, what also needs to be acknowledged is that, while based on
a modern notion of class, the relation between class and party is a
project that Labour have now embarked upon, not a direct and natural
transfer of allegiance that can be taken for granted. This means it may
take time, and the work of political education and grass roots
organising, to build solidarity based on shared interests and create the
social and political consciousness within the entirety of the working
class today that is adequate to rebuilding a [new labour movement from
