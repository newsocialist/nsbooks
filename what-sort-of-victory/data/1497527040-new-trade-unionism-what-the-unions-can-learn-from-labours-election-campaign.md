Re-Newing Trade Unionism: What the Unions can learn from Labour's Election Campaign
===================================================================================

Union membership is in decline and yet the unions remain the most
relevant and necessary organisations that currently exist in the fight
for a better, more equal society.

Not only is union membership decreasing (down 275000 since last year),
but there is an enormous demographic crisis facing the movement. The
average age of a union member has crept up, as has the average age of an
activist. The TUC have a youth project running, which has established
that unionisation rates among the under 30s is falling - down from a
very low base in the first place.

There is much that the unions do amazingly well, but to address this
ongoing trend Trade Unions need to change.

If Jeremy Corbyn's election has taught us anything, it's that [anything
is
possible](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/13/there-is-no-unwinnable-seat-now-how-labour-revolutionised-its-doorstep-game)
- but only if we start doing things differently. It also [smashed the
notion](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/12/labour-knocking-on-doors-jeremy-corbyn-momentum)
that young people are apathetic and don't believe in the fight for
social justice. There is hope for union revival yet.

So, here's a list, not exhaustive, but written simply to facilitate
discussion and develop ideas on what the movement could start doing to
arrest its decline.

-   We need to innovate and think more creatively. The movement is now
    buzzing with ideas, we need to start listening. There is a new,
    younger generation of activists who instinctively know how to
    organise in a digital age, lets learn from them. We need to look at
    what they are doing and how we can adapt this to build workplace
    power. [The movement around the Labour Party feels vibrant,
    energised and full of
    possibility](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/14/momentum-grassroots-democracy-labour-unstoppable)
    -   the Trade Union movement can feel like this too.
-   Don't be afraid to [try new
    things](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/12/jane-mcalevey-unions-organizing-workers-socialism/),
    take risks and accept that not everything will work; establish a
    team of organisers and allow them the freedom to test creative new
    strategies that are outside the box and the flexibility to try tools
    that have worked elsewhere. If they fail, it's okay, as long as we
    learn from and constructively review those failures and bear them in
    mind for next time.

-   The Trade Union bill (whilst being a huge set back) also provides us
    with an opportunity, but only if we are ready to capitalise on it.
    The current legislation means being more strategic in our approach
    and deciding where our strength lies so we can use this as leverage
    elsewhere, it may also mean adopting more creative tactics other
    than the official walk out.

-   Semantics matters in how we communicate what the union is. The
    moment we have the first conversation sets that tone. It should
    always be around encouraging workers to join the union to get the
    tools and support to act collectively against their employer.

-   We could look to the newly radicalised layers of young activists as
    our future organisers. Build a training programme and get them out
    in the field.

-   Being a union is not about providing a service, BUT we can assist
    our members in dealing with issues that affect them outside the
    workplace in a more organic and holistic way than we currently do.
    Working people will have issues with immigration, housing and debt.
    We could link our members together so that they can assist and
    empower each other collectively within their own communities.
    Whether that is through weekly drop in sessions, communal
    gatherings, skills sharing sessions etc; addressing the needs of the
    whole worker, not just the worker in the workplace. It would open up
    further organising leads and win the trust of workers.

-   To those that exist outside the movement (most people!) our
    structures can appear outdated and inflexible. We can learn lessons
    from how younger people and the new left movement is currently
    organising - [informally,
    horizontally](http://hci.stanford.edu/publications/2015/dynamo/DynamoCHI2015.pdf)
    -   outside of rigid structures.
-   We need to [rethink how we define what a union member
    is](http://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Miller-The-Union-of-the-Future.pdf),
    including how we ask them to pay their dues. A precarious worker is
    not going to sign a membership form, particularly one that asks them
    to make a monthly direct debit. A care home worker on a zero hours
    contract isn't going to join unless they see the relevance at a
    local level. We need many more flexible levels of union membership
    suited to varying degrees of what constitutes a union member. We
    could have single issue campaign members. We could have membership
    that costs nothing until a campaign has achieved a certain goal. The
    list is not exhaustive but we need to have the debate.

-   There are currently [very](https://www.uvwunion.org.uk/)
    [small](https://iwgb.org.uk/) unions delivering tangible material
    gains for their members by building workplace power and running
    vibrant industrial campaigns. There should be more of this.

-   We need to develop [worker
    tech](https://bethnalgreenventures.com/programme/#workertech) that
    [supports organisers](http://neweconomyorganisers.org/resources) in
    building grassroots networks of workers around collective issues and
    then [allows action to be taken](https://home.coworker.org/) - BUT
    (and this is what's currently missing from current 'clicktivist'
    platforms) the collective action and networks MUST always be linked
    backed to the workers being part of a union and focuses on action
    being taken at workplace level. This isn't a replacement for
    traditional organising methods but a tool to facilitate and create a
    wider network of members.
